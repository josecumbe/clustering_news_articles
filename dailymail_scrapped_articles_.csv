0,"Facebook loses users for the first time EVER: Shares plummet 20%, wiping $200BN off value of parent-firm Meta after it revealed 500,000 fewer daily log-ins - Zuckerberg blames TikTok and pins hopes on his new Metaverse",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10471227/Facebook-loses-users-time-Zuckerberg-blames-TikTok-boom.html,"Facebook lost daily users for the first time in its 18-year history which CEOMark Zuckerberg believes was caused by the TikTok boom. 'People have a lot of choices for how they want to spend their time, and apps like TikTok are growing very quickly,'Zuckerberg said during an earnings call Wednesday, according to the Washington Post. Facebook reported a drop of nearly 500,000 in daily logins during the last three months of 2021. Zuckerberg reiterated that Meta -the company that owns Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp - is pushing hard to develop its short-form video Reels in an effort to compete with TikTok. 'This is why our focus on Reels is so important over the long term,' he added. Facebook, which now only has1.93 billion users logging in each day, also saw itsshares plunged more than 20 percent in extended trading on Wednesdayafter unexpectedly heavy spending on its Metaverse project led to a rare decline in its fourth quarter profit. Meta saw its stock fall 22.6 percent to $249.90 in after-hours trading, wiping about$200 billion off the company'smarket value. The company heavily invested in its Reality Labs segment - which includes its virtual reality headsets and augmented reality technology - during the final quarter of 2021, accounting for much of the profit decline. Analysts allege investors had expected signs of declining users growth but were 'taken aback' by the amount of ad dollars the company lost in wake of TikTok's growth. TikTok is dominating the short-form user-generated video market, despite Meta offering its own Reels product on Instagram. Data indicates the platform lost consumers to TikTok andsaw lover revenue from ads destined for its short-form videos, according to Bloomberg. The figures, however, should not have blindsided investors as there have been repeated signs that Meta was trying to compete with the new video format. Last summer,Instagram chief Adam Mosseri moved the platform's focus to embrace videos instead of its usual emphasis on photo-sharing, a move Mosseri said was inspired by TikTok's rising popularity. Zuckerberg emphasized the move during Wednesday's earnings call, reiterating that Instagram would continue to focus on Reels. The CEO has also been adamant that Meta's long-term success is dependent on his Metaverse vision. However, figures reveal the company has lost over $20 billion on Metaverse projects over the last three years. The data also revealed that consumers are being less interested in the Facebook platform, specifically in Africa and Latin America, where the loss of daily users was greatest. Some analysts allege this shows the product may be globally saturated. Meta's fourth quarter earnings reports also indicate the platform's user growth has stalled in the US and Europe, a trend witnessed over the last several years. However, Facebook previously made up for the stall by adding new users worldwide. While the decline in daily users could suggest the Facebook marketplace is saturated, analysts noteInstagram, WhatsApp, and Messenger continue to add users.The company saw a growth in the number of users logging into Facebook monthly, despite the decline in daily users. The platform also reported a slightly higher revenue per user amount. Meanwhile, Facebook has made significant investment in its virtual and augmented reality hardware ventures, including hiring more than 10,000 people to work in the Reality Labs segment and rebranding the company to Meta. 'Last year was about putting a stake in the ground for where we are heading, this year is going to be about executing,' Zuckerberg said Wednesday. The Reality Labs segment is Meta's division tasked with building Zuckerberg’s Metaverse vision. The CEO has described it as a 'virtual environment' you can enter instead of just viewing it on a screen. Theoretically, it would be a place where people can meet, work and play using virtual reality headsets, augmented reality glasses, smartphone apps or other devices. Meta Platforms Inc., formerly Facebook, took on its new name last fall to signal Zuckerberg's ambition to become a Metaverse company - and distance itself from mounting scandals after a whistleblower claimed the social media giant harms children and undermines democracy in pursuit of 'astronomical profits.' Since then, the company has been shifting resources and hiring engineers - including from competitors like Apple and Google - who can help realize his vision. Zuckerberg is betting that the Metaverse will be the next generation of the internet because he thinks it's going to be a big part of the digital economy. He expects people to start seeing Meta as a Metaverse company in the coming years, rather than a social media company. For now, though, the Metaverse exists only as an amorphous idea created by a science fiction writer. It's not yet clear if it'll be the next iteration of human-computer interaction the way Zuckerberg sees it, or just another playground for techies and gamers. Executives expect it to take 15 years to fully meet their vision. This could be spooking investors, who tend to prefer immediate, or at least quick, results on investments. 'There's a lot of uncertainty about Meta's investments in the Metaverse and if or when they will have a positive impact on the company's bottom line,' said Debra Aho Williamson, an analyst with Insider Intelligence. 'While we expect Meta to ramp up testing ads and commerce within its Metaverse offerings this year, those efforts will be highly experimental and not likely to drive much revenue in the near term,' she added. Meta's 2021 losses are in line with what Zuckerberg allegedly expected to invest in Reality Labs, CNBC reported. Spending in the department will likely only increase this year if current trends continue. Analysts also allege Meta's overall profitability for 2021 would have been more than $56 billion if it had not been for the investment in Reality Labs. The division lost $3.3 billion in the fourth quarter of 2021 - a trend demonstrated across the market. Google's Other Bets segment, which includes projects like self-driving cars and health care technology, lost $1.45 billion during the same period. However, analysts allege Reality Labs financials show the company's advantage in building the Metaverse over rivals such as Roblox or Epic Games. Meta, unlike smaller brands, has 'effectively unlimited amounts of money' to spend on its projects. Additionally, the company also forecast revenue below analysts' expectations for the current quarter. The Menlo Park, California-based company said it earned $10.29 billion, or $3.67 per share, in the final three months of 2021, down 8 percent from $11.22 billion, or $3.88 per share, in the same period a year earlier. Revenue rose to 20 percent to $33.67 billion. Experts, on average, were expecting earnings of $3.85 per share on revenue of $33.36 billion, according to a poll by FactSet. Meanwhile, Google 's parent company Alphabet has reported quarterly earnings that exceeded expectations, as the company raked in cash from online ad sales while facing lawsuits claiming it abuses its market power. Alphabet stock rose nearly 7 percent in after-hours trading on Tuesday, as the company reported fourth-quarter revenue of $75.3 billion, versus the $72.2 billion expected on Wall Street. Total Google revenue was $74.9 billion, above estimates of $71.652 billion. Google generates more revenue from internet ads than any other company, but has been accused in court filings of deceiving advertisers and publishers to reap windfall profits. Meanwhile, Meta cited a combination of other factors, including privacy changes to Apple's iOS and economic challenges, for Wednesday's decline in stock prices. The company blamed lower-than-expected growth on inflation as well as supply chain issues that are impacting advertisers' budgets. Meta also said there has been user shift to products that don't generate as much revenue as its core newsfeeds do, such as Reels videos. 'On the impressions side, we expect continued headwinds from both increased competition for people’s time and a shift of engagement within our apps towards video surfaces like Reels, which monetize at lower rates than Feed and Stories,' Facebook said in a statement issued to CNBC. The company has also been hit with a slew on scandals, including a lawsuit filed against Meta two weeks ago for allegedly turning an Oregon woman's daughter into a violent cell phone addict who has developed an eating disorder and undergone multiple psychiatric admissions in the past couple of years. Brittney Doffing told KOINher daughter was a well-adjusted teenager until she caved and bought her a smartphone for her 14th birthday in March 2020 so she could keep up with her friends during the pandemic. Doffing is suing the parent companies of Snapchat and Instagram with the help of the Social Media Victims Law Center. The lawsuit was filed on January 20 in US District Court in Oregon. It comes months after leaked research provided to The Wall Street Journal revealed that since at least 2019, Facebook has been warned that Instagram harms young girls' body image. An internal presentation found that among teens who felt suicidal, 13 percent of British users and 6 percent of American users traced their suicidal feelings to Instagram. Doffing's product liability lawsuit accuses Meta and Snap of knowing their products are dangerous when used as intended and of failing to warn users of their consequences. It also claims the social media companies facilitated the 'sexual exploitation and solicitation' of Doffing's daughter by failing to prevent anonymous, older users from contacting kids on the apps. On the same day as Doffing's lawsuit, another mother filed a wrongful death suit against Snap and Meta, accusing them of leading to her daughter's suicide in July. Meta has faced intense scrutiny over its effect on young people since former employee Frances Haugen leaked a series of internal documents to the Wall Street Journal, which published them in a series called The Facebook Files last year. One message posted on an internal message board in March 2020 said the app revealed that 32 percent of girls said Instagram made them feel worse about their bodies if they were already having insecurities. Another slide, from a 2019 presentation, said: 'We make body image issues worse for one in three teen girls. 'Teens blame Instagram for increases in the rate of anxiety and depression. This reaction was unprompted and consistent across all groups.' Another presentation found that among teens who felt suicidal, 13 percent of British users and 6 percent of American users traced their suicidal feelings to Instagram. The research not only reaffirms what has been publicly acknowledged for years - that Instagram can harm a person's body image, especially if that person is young - but it confirms that Facebook management knew as much and was actively researching it. Zuckerberg spearheaded a sharp-elbowed response to Haugen's allegations, refusing to apologize publicly and instead changing the company's name to Meta to highlight his focus on building a virtual reality Metaverse. The new lawsuits are part of a string of recent scandals for Facebook. Last week, it emerged the company had a whitelist of celebrities, influencers and politicians who were exempt from its rules because they had so many followers. Critics compared the social media site to tobacco firms which ignored science to jeopardize young people's health for the sake of profit. Others say the company, which has a near-monopoly over young people and social media, is deliberately hiding important research. Data revealed that younger users had moved away from Facebook to using Instagram. Forty percent of Instagram's 1 billion monthly users are under the age of 22 and just over half are female. Zuckerberg has been quiet in the past about the issues the app is blamed for causing among young girls. He told Congress in March 2021 that Instagram has 'positive mental-health benefits'. Instagram has a 'parental guide' which teaches parents how to monitor their kids' accounts by enabling features like screen time limits and who can comment on posts, but there's no way to verify someone's age before they join the site. Instagram claims it only accepts users aged 13 and over but says many lie about it when they join. The social media platform also does not flag any photograph or image that may have been distorted or manipulated, despite flagging materials it deems to contain misinformation, political posts or paid advertising. The group of teens who said they were negatively impacted by the app were aged 13 and above. Zuckerberg even announced plans to launch a product for kids under the age of 13. He told Congress that it would be safe, answering 'I believe the answer is yes' when asked if the effects of how safe it would be would be studied. Facebook has not shared the research before. In August, when asked for information on how its products harmed young girls, it responded in a letter to Senators: 'We are not aware of a consensus among studies or experts about how much screen time is ""too much.""' Senator Richard Blumenthal told the Journal that Facebook's answers were vague which raised questions that it was deliberately hiding the research. 'Facebook's answers were so evasive - failing to respond to all our questions - that they really raise questions about what Facebook might be hiding. 'Facebook seems to be taking a page from the textbook of Big Tobacco - targeting teens with potentially dangerous products while masking the science in public.'"
1,Jeff Zucker and girlfriend Allison Gollust both 'BROKE CNN ethics rules by playing instrumental roles in getting Andrew Cuomo to appear on brother Chris' show': Questions now emerge about her future at the network,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10471109/Jeff-Zucker-girlfriend-broke-CNN-ethics-rules-helping-secure-Andrew-Cuomo-interviews.html,"CNN's president Jeff Zucker and his girlfriend Allison Gollust lobbied Andrew Cuomo to appear on their network during the pandemic, it was reported on Wednesday night - violating company policy and calling into question their own condemnation of Chris Cuomo's actions. Zucker, 56, resigned on Wednesday night once his relationship with Gollust, the 49-year-old executive vice president for communications, became known. He was 'outed' by lawyers working for fired anchor Chris Cuomo, who The New York Post reported went to Zucker's bosses, executives at parent company AT&T, to inform of his relationship. Cuomo's lawyers are trying to get an $18 million payout from CNN, for the remainder of his contract - arguing that Zucker was aware of his actions to help his brother, former governor Andrew Cuomo, during the sex scandal that ultimately forced his resignation. They pointed out to AT&T executives that Zucker was accusing Chris Cuomo of violating company policy by helping his brother, when Zucker himself was violating company policy by having a relationship with his subordinate. Jason Kilar, AT&T chief executive, addressed CNN staff in Washington DC on Wednesday and was asked by Jake Tapper, another anchor, whether CNN had let 'the bad guy' win. Tapper said, according to The Wall Street Journal, that Chris Cuomo hired a lawyer who hinted at leaking damaging information about Zucker unless they gave Cuomo severance. 'An outside observer might say, 'Well, it looks like Chris Cuomo succeeded,' Tapper said. 'He threatened Jeff. Jeff said we don't negotiate with terrorists. 'And Chris blew the place up. How do we get past that perception that this is the bad guy winning?' 1986: Zucker hired as an Olympics researcher for NBC 1989: Zucker starts working as producer on Today 1996: Zucker marries his NBC colleague Caryn 2000: Zucker promoted to president of entertainment at NBC after boosting ratings on Today He meets Gollust at NBC. 2003: Zucker promoted to head of news, cable and entertainment at NBC 2005: Zucker becomes head of NBC Universal, new umbrella brand 2007: Zucker becomes President and CEO of NBC Universal 2010: Zucker leaves NBC, taking a package of between $30m-$40m dollars 2011: Zucker joins Katie Couric as producer on her ABC show 2012: Zucker joins CNN 2018: Zucker and his wife Caryn split 2021: Zucker announces plans to leave the company at the end of the year. He then said he would stay on until TimeWarner's deal with Discovery was complete Erik Wemple, The Washington Post's media critic, reported on Wednesday that Zucker and Gollust had broken CNN's rules when dealing with Andrew Cuomo - backing Chris Cuomo's version of events. Chris Cuomo insisted that his interactions with his brother were done with the full knowledge of his bosses, and with their support. Wemple said that Chris Cuomo's interviews with his brother during the pandemic, which first sparked questions about the news anchor's boundaries with his governor brother, were encouraged by Zucker and Gollust. Gollust worked for Andrew Cuomo as a communications director for four months, before joining CNN. 'According to several sources, Gollust and Zucker were instrumental in securing the Cuomo-on-Cuomo interviews,' tweeted Wemple. 'Though Andrew Cuomo's staff assented to the early appearances, they had second thoughts about continuing the series. 'When the governor's staff pushed back at CNN booking appeals, according to sources, Gollust appealed directly to the governor, who she'd known from her short stint as his communications director years before. 'A CNN spokesperson notes that executives pressing public officials for interviews is standard practice, and that's 100 percent correct. Gollust reportedly argued for appearances on non-Chris Cuomo shows, too. 'Yet it's noteworthy that the upper reaches of the organization got personally involved in arranging interviews that conflicted with CNN standards, even if the network famously crafted an exception for the Cuomo-on-Cuomo affairs.' He concluded: 'As I argued months ago, the glare of accountability shouldn't have fallen exclusively on Chris Cuomo. And now it appears it hasn't.' The Post reported thatAT&T has not paid Chris Cuomo the $18 million he believes he is entitled to, but he has at least 'achieved some vindication.' A source told the paper: 'How do you fire a journalist who violates a policy while the CEO gets away with violating a policy?' Earlier on Wednesday, DailyMail.com confirmed that lawyers for Chris Cuomo wrote to the network demanding that all communications between Zucker, Gollust, and Chris's brother Andrew. Chris's lawyers sought the preservation of the communications as proof both that Zucker had a conflict of interest, while he was accusing Chris of his own conflict of interest in helping his brother. Zucker resigned from his $6 million-a-year job at the network on Wednesday, forced out by the revelations from Chris's legal team of a conflict of interest. Zucker was highly prized by the network, and his contract was due to expire on December 31, 2021, but was extended to see him carry on working through the merger with Discovery. If his contract contained a severance clause, that payout could now be in jeopardy because his undisclosed relationship with a fellow employee violates company policy. Zucker's refusal to pay out the remained of Chris Cuomo's contract, worth an estimated $18 million, is key to his own downfall. Zucker has argued that his fallen star anchor cannot claim the payout because his conduct - in advising his brother - brought the network into disrepute. That same argument, of violating company policy, could now see Zucker miss out on his own payout, which would likely be worth many millions. A source says that besides the emails and other communications that would reveal the long term intimacy between Zucker and Gollust, they would also reveal how Zucker pressured Andrew Cuomo to appear on CNN and how he pushed his personal agenda about Donald Trump and other conservatives with 'potent negative story lines.' Chris Cuomo blewthe whistle on Zucker's years-long, open-secret affair with Gollust while fighting for his $18million severance pay, according unnamed media sources. In a statement on Wednesday, Zucker said he was stepping down for failing to disclose his relationship with Gollust when he was being interviewed as part of the investigation into Chris Cuomo. He and Gollust claim the romance started during COVID, but media sources tell DailyMail.com it long predates the pandemic and was an open-secret in the CNN offices. They lived in the same apartment building with their respective families, have worked together at NBC and then at CNN for more than 20 years, and had what some called an 'uncomfortably cozy' rapport. They are both now divorced, and one source told DailyMail.com that their splits were due in part to their affair. Politico cites two unnamed sources who say Chris Cuomo's legal team brought the romance to the surface during negotiations for the ousted host's severance pay. Chris was fired last December after an internal investigation found he had helped his brother Andrew navigate through a sexual misconduct scandal, while still working as a CNN host. One of the CNN executives stepping up to replace outgoing boss Jeff Zucker is his old Harvard friend and 'longtime loyalist' with an uncannily similar career trajectory. Michael Bass - among three people named interim network leaders Wednesday - is, like Zucker, an ivy league alumni with vast experience at competing networks including NBC, where Zucker once served as the company's chief executive. Until a permanent replacement is named, Bass will lead the network alongside veteran executives Amy Entelis and Ken Jautz. Bass, a married father of three, took over as interim executive producer of the Today show in 2000 after Zucker was named NBC Entertainment's president. When Zucker was promoted to the company's top boss in 2007, Bass's career path kept pace as he became NBC's vice president of strategic initiatives. Zucker also tapped Bass to serve as co-executive producer of Katie Couric's eponymous talk show in 2012. In an yet another similarity, both graduated from Harvard in the mid-1980s and Bass followed Zucker to CNN. Katie Couric, who has worked with both men, described their different management styles in her explosive tell-all 'Going There'. 'Jeff Zucker's feet may only have been size 9, but he left huge shoes to fill when he became president of NBC Entertainment,' she wrote. 'He'd handpicked his friend Michael Bass, a fellow Harvard guy and longtime loyalist, to step in as acting EP at Today. 'Michael was an incredibly nice and a solid producer but lacked Jeff's shrewdness and pizzazz (yeoman-like was a word that got used), which showed in the broadcast. Suddenly it felt like slow, boring, blah.' Bass most recently served as CNN's executive vice president of programming. He is still fighting for $18million - the remainder of his contract - but Zucker had refused to pay out, citing the conflict of interest between Chris's relationship with his brother and his on-air reporting for CNN. According to Politico's sources, Cuomo's team said it was hypocritical for Zucker to fire Chris for a conflict of interest when he has one of his own in his relationship with Gollust. Gollust is also divorced. She and her husband Billy - who runs a trading platform - split in 2015, and divorced in 2017. Billy has not commented. One source told DailyMail.com on Wednesday that the affair was an open secret for years. 'Jeff's affair with Allison has been going on forever – not since COVID!Everyone has known it but he still denied it. 'It was part of the reason for his divorce, but not the only reason. 'It was inevitable that it would come out – he should have been up front sooner.' Another said: 'It was the worst-kept secret inside the building. 'Jeff's office was right next to Allison's office at Hudson Yards and before that at the Time Warner Center on Columbus Circle. 'The joke was they weren't only sharing a wall. No one believes that this only happened over pandemic. 'They have been close for years. 'The closest it ever came to being outed was when Page Sixreported on their 'heavy exchange' at the Hollywood Reporter's 35 Most Powerful People in NY Media party. 'They had a very public fight at the party that didn't seem to have anything to do with work.' Zucker admits lying about when the romance began during the investigation into whether or not Chris Cuomo, formerly the network's most successful host, helped his brother through his sexual harassment scandal. 'I acknowledged the relationship evolved in recent years. I was required to disclose it when it began but I didn't. I was wrong. 'As a result, I am resigning today,' he said. According to an internal email, Michael Bass, Amy Entelis and Ken Jautz will take over as interim bosses, with Bass heading up the new leadership team. But sources say Bass - who Zucker promoted to replace him as Executive Producer on the Today show -is one of Zucker's right-hand men and shouldn't be considered for the job. 'The appointment of Michael Bass to the top job – even on an interim basis is outrageous. 'Michael and Jeff are very close friends. Both went to Harvard and both have looked after each other throughout their careers. 'It's such a boys club and an absolute joke.' Zucker is widely concerned one of the most powerful men in media. He has made a long list of enemies throughout his career - most notably Donald Trump, who celebrated his resignation. Zucker's resignation is effective immediately but Gollust will stay on at the network asan Executive Vice President of PR at CNN, and will be staying on in her role despite Zucker's departure. Chris Cuomo has been at war with CNN since he was fired in early December. The network fired him after an investigation by the New York Attorney General's Office revealed the deep extent to which he'd helped his brother Andrew. Chris ignored the subject on his nightly CNN talk show, but used his journalistic sources to research some of the women making claims against his brother, according to the AG report. CNN also received a claim that he had been sexually inappropriate with a staff member in the days before he was fired. Chris Cuomo vehemently denied that claim. Gollust, who said she will remain at the network, confirmed the affair in a statement Wednesday released to theNew York Times. 'Jeff and I have been close friends and professional partners for over 20 years,' she wrote. 'Recently, our relationship changed during COVID. I regret that we didn't disclose it at the right time. 'I'm incredibly proud of my time at CNN and look forward to continuing the great work we do everyday.' The couple was spotted together at a Billy Joel concert last November, where they were called out for defying mask regulations, but their romance was not picked up on. In 2017, Zucker and Gollust were seen in a heated argument at the Hollywood Reporter's 35 Most Powerful People in NY Media party. A source explained at the time that while the party was taking place, Zucker and Gollust suddenly started intensely speaking and making anguished hand gestures before Gollust stormed away into the crowd. 'It looked like she was reprimanding her husband or something,' mocked an unnamed rival news executive at the time. Other journalists have pointed to the romance too. In her book, Katie Couric told of how Zucker tried to push Gollust onto Couric's show, despite the fact there was no role for her. 'I had to wonder why Jeff was angling so hard to bring Allison on board. 'She and her husband and kids had moved into the apartment right above Jeff and Caryn's—everyone who heard about their cozy arrangement thought it was super strange. 'By that point, Caryn (Zucker's ex-wife) had become a close friend and it made me really uncomfortable,' Katie wrote in her memoir. Zucker made a long-list of enemies over the years at CNN, most notable of whom is Donald Trump. Trump celebrated his resignation on Wednesday, saying in an emailed statement: 'Jeff Zucker, a world-class sleazebag who has headed ratings and real-news-challenged CNN for far too long, has been terminated for numerous reasons, but predominantly because CNN has lost its way with viewers and everybody else. 'Now is a chance to put Fake News in the backseat because there may not be anything more important than straightening out the horrendous LameStream Media in our Country, and in the case of CNN, throughout the World. 'Jeff Zucker is gone—congratulations to all!' he said. Megyn Kelly, former FOX News host, tweeted: 'Zucker's relationship with Gollust went on for years, and what he did to keep her near him (as he kept advancing her up the line) will be even more stunning to the CNN news room.' Chris Cuomo refused to leave CNN quietly after being fired for helping quash sex assault allegations against his brother, disgraced ex-New York Governor Andrew Cuomo - and he was 'trying to burn the place down' when he ousted Jeff Zucker's secret relationship with a senior network executive. Cuomo has always maintained that Zucker knew the extent to which he had helped his brother while he was in office, and the network boss ignored calls to fire him for months. The final straw came after New York AG Letitia James' office released damning evidence where text messages proved he was more deeply involved than he'd let on. Although he was suspended, he was ultimately fired when a lawyer told CNN he was being investigated for sexually harassing a co-worker years earlier at a different network. But, according to CNN's own chief media correspondent Brian Stelter, Cuomo refused to go quietly because his $18 million exit package was on the line. Cuomo's legal team ultimately told CNN investigators that it washypocritical to suggest that the host had a personal conflict of interest while Zucker had failed to disclose his own relationship with comms chief Allison Gollust - even though it was an 'open secret' at the company. Sources told Politco: 'Cuomo's legal team asserted that Zucker was hypocritical to suggest Cuomo had a personal conflict of interest when the relationship with Gollust represented a potential conflict as well,' the outlet reported. On Wednesday, Stelter said that sources told him that Cuomo was 'trying to burn the place down' and had claimed that he had 'incriminating evidence about Zucker and Gollust.' 'If that's the case, this is a domino effect, that begins with Andrew Cuomo going down in the governor's office, and then Chris Cuomo gets fired from CNN, and then Jeff Zucker losing his job.' In December, a spokesman for Cuomo accused Zucker of knowing everything about his involvement in trying to help his brother while he navigated a sexual harassment scandal. 'They were widely known to be extremely close and in regular contact, including about the details of Mr. Cuomo's support for his brother,' the spokesman told the Wall Street Journal. 'There were no secrets about this, as other individuals besides Mr. Cuomo can attest.' CNN then hit back, saying: 'He has made a number of accusations that are patently false. This reinforces why he was terminated for violating our standards and practices, as well as his lack of candor.' And while Cuomo was placed on leave after evidence from James' office proved just how involved he was in trying to quash his allegations against his brother, he was ultimately fired days later when a lawyer contacted the network with a sexual harassment allegation stemming from his previous job at ABC. Employment lawyer Debra S. Katz said the allegation against him was made by a former junior colleague at another network, and was unrelated to his brother, former New York governor Andrew Cuomo. Further details about the allegation were unclear. Cuomo's spokesman denied the claim, saying: 'These apparently anonymous allegations are not true.' CNN's statement announcing Cuomo's termination cited only his 'conduct with his brother's defense' in its decision to terminate the anchor. The popular host's downfall came when documents revealed how heexchanged dozens of text messages with his brother Andrew's top aide, Melissa DeRosa. Cuomo told investigators under oath that they only had 'irregular contact'. But the unearthed texts detailed Cuomo's true role in his brother's public relations crisis as he told senior members of the governor's team, 'we are making mistakes we cant afford.' In one text, on March 3, he also asked DeRosa to 'please let me help with prep'. Cuomo - who earned $6 million annually at CNN, according to Celebrity Net Worth-told investigators that he reached out to a 'non-journalistic' source while fishing for information on one of his brother's accusers. Though he admitted to researching forthcoming accusers, he vehemently denied to investigators setting out to discredit them. 'I would never do oppo research on anybody alleging anything like this,' he told investigators.'I'm not in the oppo research business. I don't tolerate a lot of oppo research on any level.' When asked to define 'oppo research', he said: 'the idea of trying to find ways to disparage people who come forward with allegations like this is not what I'm about.' Cuomo's text exchanges contradict his claims to investigators that he had 'irregular contact' with DeRosa. His testimony was subject to the penalty of perjury. He on March 12 sent her a text, dictating how the governor should respond to calls for his resignation. 'READ THIS,' Cuomo said. 'I will not resign. I cannot resign. I am in a different position and I am working with a different standard than these other politicians I understand why they have to say what they are saying. 'I understand the political pressure I understand the stakes of political warfare, and that's what this is… And I understand the conformity that can be forced by cancel culture.' Discussions centered around Andrew Cuomo stepping down prompted the governor to consider doing so in March, Cuomo said. 'I told him, 'If you have done nothing that you believe was wrong, don't resign,' Cuomo told investigators. 'Because resigning is you saying that you did something wrong. Don't do it.' Inside Jeff Zucker and Allison Gollust's 'cozy' relationship: As 'open-secret affair' sparks CNN boss's exit, how duo became 'joined at the hip' 20 years ago and even lived one floor apart in SAME New York apartment building From Jeff helping Allison, 49, land her current job at CNN to living in the same apartment building with their respective families, the two have, according to former colleague Katie Couric, been 'joined at the hip' for more than two decades. Where it all began, as colleagues at NBC Harvard graduate Jeff and Allison - who began her career as a news anchor, reporter, and producer in Denver, Colorado - first met when they both worked at NBC. According to her CNN profile, Allison started working for the company in 1996, six years after Jeff earned his first role within the network, and one year later, she was named as the senior publicist for the Today show. Allison then served as the executive vice president of corporate communications for NBC, where she oversaw all aspects of the company's global communications efforts. As for Jeff, who graduated from Harvard University in 1986, he started as a field producer for the Today show, where he rose through the ranks, eventually earning the job as executive producer on the show, before being named as the president of NBC Entertainment in 2000. In her book, Going There, former NBC host Couric recalled her first encounter with Jeff, who was at the time a budding writer-producer, in 1990, describing him as being a 'nerd' who was 'seemed a little cocky, especially for someone so young'. Then, on February 6, 2007, Jeff became president and CEO of NBC Universal. Despite gaining a lot of power at NBC, Jeff was shoved out of the company in 2010, after its merger with Comcast Corporation. The Los Angeles Times reported at the time that Comcast Chief Operating Officer Steve Burke 'told Jeff that he wanted him to 'move on' as soon as Comcast took control of the media conglomerate.' During his time at NBC, Jeff had several misfires - most notably, when he brought in independent producer Ben Silverman, which ultimately caused NBC's ratings to plummet. He was also slammed for moving Jay Leno's show to prime time, which negatively impacted the number of viewers. Looking out for one another: How Jeff tried to snag Allison a job alongside him on Katie Couric's show Both of them left NBC within months of one another in 2010, and Jeff spent several months without a job, before reuniting with former colleague Couric in 2011 in order to produce her self-titled daytime talkshow. However, even after they both departed NBC, Jeff and Allison remained incredibly close. So close, in fact, that Jeff fought hard to get Allison a job on Katie's show while he was there. The talk show host claimed in her 2021 memoir, Going There, that Jeff made a 'huge push' to bring Allison onto their staff, but they unfortunately didn't have a role for her. 'They were joined at the hip. The problem was, we'd already hired a PR person for the show. There really wasn't a role for Allison,' she wrote.'I had to wonder why Jeff was angling so hard to bring Allison on board.' In late 2012, rumors started to circulate that Jeff was planning to leave Katie's show to join CNN, andKatie later claimed that he and Allison had teamed up to plant those stories - writing that 'everyone knew he and Allison had Page Six on speed dial.' Jeff then became the president of CNN onJanuary 1, 2013. Reuniting at CNN: How Jeff brought Allison on-board as his first hire After leaving NBC, Allison took a job as then-New York Governor Andrew Cuomo's communications director at the end of 2012. However, just four months later, it was revealed that she had quit the role and was moving to CNN. '[Jeff's] first hire?' Katie wrote in her book. 'Allison Gollust.' She was hired at the company as senior vice president of communications. 'Allison is among the most experienced and respected communications executives in the media industry, and her close working relationship with Jeff Zucker is one of its most successful professional partnerships,' Jeff Matteson, senior vice president of communications for Turner Broadcasting System, Inc., said at the time. Jeff added in a statement: 'In the 15 years that Allison and I have worked together, I've depended on her judgment, counsel and relationships. 'Allison is joining CNN at an exciting time, and she and the strong communications team she's inheriting will play a critical role in shaping the organization and its story going forward. It's great to have her at CNN.' Living in close quarters: Pair spark speculation after moving into the same apartment building just one floor apart Jeff and Allison lived in the same apartment building on the Upper East Side with their respective families until Jeff sold his in 2020, after he and his ex-wife - supervisor of Saturday Night Life Caryn Stephanie Nathanson - split. The building is located at on the corner of Madison Avenue in Manhattan, New York. He resided in apartment 3W, while Allison lived in the unit right above him - number 4W - which she still owns. Katie later claimed that their 'cozy arrangement' was 'super strange' and made her 'really uncomfortable.' She said in her book: '[Allison] and her husband and kids had moved into the apartment right above Jeff and [his wife] Caryn's - everyone who heard about their cozy arrangement thought it was super strange. 'By that point, Caryn had become a close friend and it made me really uncomfortable.' Allison's apartment has two bedrooms and two and a half bathrooms, while Jeff's contained five bedrooms and four and a half bathrooms. He sold it for $15.4 million. Both of them also own Hampton houses within 20 minutes from one another. According to public sales records, Jeff's home hasn't been put up for sale since he purchased it in 1999 - however it's not known whether he or his wife took ownership of it in the divorce. Records also show that Allison still owners her Hampton home. Leaving their respective partners: Lengthy marriages both end in divorce Jeff and his ex-wife split in 2018 after 21 years of marriage, due to reportedly 'growing apart.' A source toldPage Six at the time: 'It can't be easy being married to Jeff - he is a workaholic, and is obsessed with news, and obsessed with being the best. 'Caryn is much more laid back and social, spends a lot of time with their kids and enjoys being part of the Upper East Side social circuit. 'They've had their problems over the years. Things have been bad for 10 years, but they have now accepted their marriage is over, and he has moved out of their apartment.' The former couple share four kids together - three daughters and a son. As for Allison, she was previously married to Billy Hult,the president of online marketplace platform Tradeweb. According to RadarOnline, they broke up 12 months after Jeff and Caryn finalized their divorced. Before they split, they welcomed two daughters together namedOlivia and Ava. Now, sources have claimed that both of their marriages ended because of their budding romance. An insider told DailyMail.com on Wednesday: 'It was part of the reason for his divorce, but not the only reason. It was inevitable that it would come out – he should have been up front sooner.' Going public with their romance: Couple claim their 'relationship changed during COVID' According to Allison, who said she will remain at the network, however, it wasn't until the COVID-19 pandemic hit that things turned romantic between them. 'Jeff and I have been close friends and professional partners for over 20 years,' she wrote. 'Recently, our relationship changed during COVID,' she said in a statement released to the New York Times. 'I regret that we didn't disclose it at the right time. I'm incredibly proud of my time at CNN and look forward to continuing the great work we do everyday.' In a memo to CNN staff on Wednesday, Jeff spoke out about it too. He said: 'As part of the investigation into Chris Cuomo's tenure at CNN, I was asked about a consensual relationship with my closest colleague, someone I have worked with for more than 20 years. 'I acknowledged the relationship evolved in recent years. I was required to disclose it when it began but I didn't. I was wrong.'  "
2,Rudy Giuliani is revealed as star of The Masked Singer - prompting judges Robin Thicke and Ken Jeong to walk off set in protest ,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-10470753/Rudy-Giuliani-SHOCKINGLY-unmasked-Foxs-Masked-Singer-prompting-judge-walkout.html,"Rudy Giuliani caused quite a stiras he was unmasked during a taping of the first episode for season seven ofFox's The Masked Singer last week, as reported byDeadline. The 77-year-old politician's shocking unmasking reportedly prompted a dramatic reaction from judges Ken Jeong and Robin Thicke. The outlet reports that Ken and Robin 'quickly left the stage in protest' of Rudy's involvement. Remaining judges Jenny McCarthy andNicole Scherzingerremained onstage amid the uproar. It was reported that McCarthy and Scherzinger 'bantered' with Rudy, who is a controversial figure in the political realm due to his ties to former President Donald J. Trump and for pressing that the 2020 election was 'stolen' from the 75-year-old. A source close to the production said that Ken and Robin eventually returned to the judges panel. As part of the singing competition show, celebrity contestants don elaborate costumes and even have their voices altered in order to conceal their identities until elimination. Deadline did not reveal any details about Rudy's performance or his costume. Season seven of The Masked Singer is centered on the theme 'The Good, The Bad and The Cuddly.' It is set to premiere on Wednesday, March 9 on Fox. This is not the first time that The Masked Singer has sparked controversy over its choice of contestants. Republican politician and former Alaska governor Sarah Palin was unmasked after appearing on the show in 2020 as 'Bear.' She was eliminated after performing a rendition ofSir Mix-A-Lot's Baby Got Back. Though Palin, 57, described the experience as 'the weirdest thing I've ever done,' she praised the show for inviting a conservativecontestant into the mix. 'It's all about fun. It's unity. This is all good. This something that our country needs right now,' she explained to host Nick Cannon. News of Rudy's involvement in the upcoming season of The Masked Singer comes after former impeachment witness Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman filed a suit against him and Donald Trump. Jr. on Wednesday, charging them with having falsely attacked his loyalty to the U.S. and punishing him for his testimony. Vindman, a retired Army lieutenant colonel, also lashed out at the defendants in an op-ed, where he cited his removal from the White House National Security Council and a delay in his Army promotion. 'I was attacked in a way calculated to inflict maximum personal and professional damage likely in order to prevent me from testifying or to punish me for doing so. In this country, that violates the law,' he writes. He is suing four officials for intimidation and retaliation, writing: 'I wish I had done so sooner, both for my sake and for the other public servants who have been similarly tested.' Vindman was on Trump's infamous phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky when Trump asked for help digging up dirt on President Biden's son, Hunter. He was subpoenaed to testify in Trump's impeachment after reporting the contents of the call. His suit alleges the group carried out a 'coordinated campaign' based on 'common understanding and agreement' to target him for 'intimidation and retaliation.' It says the attacks were to paint him as 'disloyal' to the U.S. and having 'engaged in ""espionage.""' He says they destroyed his ability to serve in a national security or foreign policy roleThe Ukraine-born Vindman served on the NSC along with his twin brother Yevgeny as an expert in Ukrainian affairs. He was director of European Affairs on the NSC. He cites the Ku Klux Klan act of 1871, which is also cited in lawsuits by some lawmakers against Trump over Jan. 6th. The suit says Don Jr. serves as Trump's 'emissary to the media, names Giuliani as a longtime advisor, targets Scavino for overseeing Trump's Twitter account, and names White House official Julia Hahn, who served as special assistant at the White House after working for TV host Laura Ingraham and Breitbart News. Vindman immigrated to the U.S. in 1979 and was awarded the Purple Heart. Trump fired Vindman and his brother following the impeachment effort, which resulted in his acquittal. Vindmans' suit references an array of media figures as well as prior attacks Trump allies organized against former FBI official Andrew McCabe as it accuses the group of a conspiracy against him. A long passage on Fox news commentator Laura Ingraham and her ties to the Trump White House recalls her report that Vindman 'usually' spoke English as part of an effort to 'smear' him. It quotes a comment by John Yoo, a former Justice Department official who was a guest on her show, and responded to the comment: 'I find that astounding, and in – you know, some people might call that espionage.' The suit does not name either Ingraham or Yoo. It includes a Giuliani tweet that Vindman has 'reportedly been advising two gov's,' saying it implied he had 'dual loyalties.' DailyMail.com has reached out to the Trump Organization for comment. Giuliani is best known for serving as mayor of New York City from 1994 to 2001 and washeralded for his response the 9/11 attacks. He coordinated the response and organized the support of state and federal authorities for the World Trade Center site, for citywide anti-terrorist measures, and for restoration of infrastructure. He has since become a controversial figure over his support for Donald Trump's election fraud claims. Giuliani's Upper East Side apartment was raided by the FBI in April amid a probe into his dealings with the Ukraine, although he is yet to be charged with any crime, and denies all allegations of wrongdoing."
3,Manhattan public school principal CANCELS performance of Shakespeare's Merchant of Venice over anti-Semitic portrayal of money lender Shylock: Angry parents say she has missed a 'teachable moment',https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10470763/Manhattan-middle-school-CANCELS-Shakespeares-Merchant-Venice-play-amid-anti-Semitism-concerns.html,"A middle school in Manhattan has canceled its production of Shakespeare's The Merchant of Venice after some parents expressed concern over anti-Semitic themes and whether the material is appropriate for middle schoolers. The play was set to be performed by the seventh-grade drama students at75 Morton, a popular middle school in Greenwich Village, but scrapped last month by the first-year principal without any warning. School sources told the New York Post there was a divide between parents at the school, with some calling for the play's cancelation and others wanting to open a dialogue about the themes of the play. The news of play's cancelation comes after a Tennessee school board scrapped the Holocaust-themed graphic novel Maus, voting unanimously to remove the Pulitzer Prize-winning book from its eighth-grade curriculum over a drawing of a nude woman, eight swear wordsand its 'not wise or healthy' content. The controversy has led to some heated opinions and even the suspension ofThe View host Whoopi Goldbergover her comments in response to the banning of the book. Now the Greenwich Village school is embroiled in controversy over the 16th-century Shakespeare classic bouta merchant in Venice named Antonio who defaults on a large loan provided by a Jewish money lendernamed Shylock — a term that has come to be considered an anti-Semitic slur. A few Jewish parents asked administrators if the material was appropriate for middle schoolers. 'The way that anti-Semitism is shown in this play, if you don't have a minimum of knowledge and context you can't understand how bad and dangerous it is,' a member of the school community told The Post. Valerie Leak, the first-year principal, had reportedly pledged to hold meetings with parents to discuss the matter, school sources told The Post. She was also expected to meet with drama teachers and members of the Theater for a New Audience, theManhattan-based group that is in collaboration with the school to produce the plays. But parents tell The Post that these discussions never happened, and the play was just abruptly canceled. Joe Sherinsky, one of the parents at the school, told The Post he believed the principal missed a 'teachable moment.' 'I think it needs to be properly contextualized,' he said. 'There are great lessons in the Merchant of Venice. You can takes names like Shylock and apply them broadly into lessons about racism. But in order to teach that properly you need to have enough context as parents to say that this is something good for the school to do.' He has praised Leak overall, but saidhe would have liked a more meaningful exchange on the issue. Instead, parents received an email from the school last month explaining the cancelation. 'Members of our community have expressed their objection to this play due to concerns about racist and anti-Semitic language,' school officials wrote to parents of drama students in an email. 'And while the company designed the curriculum with input from the ADL (Anti-Defamation League) to ensure that the challenging themes of the piece would be treated with the proper critical analysis, sensitivity, and thoughtfulness, we have decided to move forward with a different unit with the Theater.' Instead of selecting a new production, the school opted to focus on a playwriting curriculum. 'This decision did not come lightly, as we worked diligently with TFNA and listened to the members of our community to resolve concerns,' the school's email continued. 'However, we believe this is the right decision to make at this time.' Last week, the McMinn County Board of Education voted 10-0 to remove 'Maus' by Art Spiegelman from the curriculum on January 10, despite educators arguing that the graphic novel is an 'anchor text' in eighth-grade English language arts instruction and the centerpiece of a months-long study of the Holocaust. Published in 1991, Maus is inspired by the story of Spiegelman's parents, Vladek and Anja, who survived the Holocaust after being shipped to the Auschwitz concentration camp in Poland. The graphic novel depicts Nazis as cats and Jewish people as mice. The board heard from instructional supervisors and other school officials who defended the use of the book in class but were unanimously overruled. Spiegelman, 73, called the ban 'Orwellian' in an interview withCNBC, saying that he learned about it on Wednesday, a day before Holocaust Remembrance Day. The Holocaust Museum has defended the book and said it plays a 'vital role' in teaching about the World War II-era genocide. Board members' objections revolved around a drawing of a nude woman and eight swear words that appear throughout the 296-page book, according tominutesfrom the meeting. The novel won the Pulitzer in 1992 and has since been lauded for helping to usher in a new era of graphic novels, in which they were seen as a respectable form of adult media. The ban comes as parents and school boards across the country debate how to teach the history of racism at schools, if at all. Last year, the Republican-controlled Tennessee General Assembly voted to withhold funding from schools that teach 'critical race theory,' effectively banning it, according to the Tennessean. Whoopi Goldberg sparked international fury on Monday by claimingthat the Holocaust 'was not about race' because it involved 'two groups of white people.' She was suspended from the shows for two weeks on Wednesday despite issuing an apology."
4,"Covid symptoms appear just two days after being exposed to the virus, study shows - much earlier than previously thought ",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10470707/Covid-symptoms-appear-just-two-days-exposed-virus-study-shows.html,"Coronavirussymptoms appear just two days after being exposed to the virus - much earlier than previously thought, a study has found. Under the landmark Human Challenge Programme, 36 healthy young adults were deliberately infected with Covid-19 at a London hospital. The study found symptoms took on average just two days to appear, compared to previous estimates of around five to six days by the World Health Organisation (WHO). The Government-backed research, led by Imperial College London, involved volunteers aged 18 to 29 who had never had Covid before. They were kept in a quarantine unit for at least 14 days at the Royal Free Hospital and deliberately given a very small dose of coronavirus via nasal drops. Of the group, just 53 per cent went on to develop Covid-19. The authors said the fact nearly half of the volunteers avoided the disease could hold help uncover why some peole have managed to avoid infection throughout the pandemic. Experts found that coronavirus infection first appears in the throat and then symptoms peak on around day five, when levels of virus are significantly higher in the nose. Sixteen of the group developed mild-to-moderate cold-like symptoms, including a stuffy or runny nose, sneezing and sore throat, but none fell seriously ill. Lead author Professor Chris Chiu said: ‘Very shortly after they are given the virus, within two days, people start to have detectable virus, first in the throat but then in the nose, which rises very quickly.’ He said that, among those who had no symptoms, some still have very low levels of viral detection, suggesting there may be an immune process going on to suppress the infection. The study also found that lateral flow tests are highly effective at picking up the virus. Co-author Dr Andrew Catchpole, chief scientific officer at hVIVO, said the findings would also apply to the Delta and Omicron variants even though the study used the ‘original’ Covid-19 variant. He said: ‘This shows the potential of the virus to replicate very, very quickly. ‘We haven’t done Delta or Omicron in challenge studies so all we can do is speculate what might be seen. ‘What we do know - from what’s seen in the field - is that those viruses do... transmit very quickly and replicate very quickly, so we would expect there to be a lot of transferrable data between the two.’ The study also found that high levels of viable (infectious) virus could still be picked up in lab tests for up to nine days, and 12 days in some cases. Peak levels of virus were significantly higher in the nose than in the throat, suggesting a potentially greater risk of virus being shed from the nose than the mouth, it said. The researchers said this highlights the need for people to use facemasks properly that cover both the mouth and nose. Professor Sir Jonathan Van-Tam, deputy chief medical officer for England, said: ‘Scientifically these studies offer real advantage because the timing of exposure to the virus is always known exactly, therefore things like the interval between exposure and the profile of virus shedding can be accurately described. ‘This important study has provided further key data on Covid-19 and how it spreads, which is invaluable in learning more about this novel virus, so we can fine-tune our response. ‘Challenge studies could still prove to be important in the future to speed the development of ‘next-generation’ Covid-19 vaccines and antiviral drugs. ‘This data underline just how useful a tool lateral flow tests can be to pick up people when infectious and the importance of wearing a face covering in crowded, enclosed spaces.’"
5,GoFundMe FREEZES Canadian 'Freedom Convoy' page after it raised $8 million and police chief threatens to call in the army - while the truckers feed the homeless as they occupy Ottawa,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10470807/Ottawas-police-chief-says-force-1-500-powerless-end-Canadian-capitals-truckers-blockade.html,"A GoFundMe campaign that was organized to support the Canadian truckers demonstration and which has raised nearly $8million was suspended on Wednesday night - as the Freedom Convoy that has paralyzed Ottawa entered its sixth day. 'This fundraiser is currently paused and under review to ensure it complies with our terms of service and applicable laws and regulations,' the page stated. 'Our team is working 24/7 and doing all we can to protect both organizers and donors. Thank you for your patience.' Videos released from the nation's capital showed the protesters delivering food to the homeless as crowds cheered and waived flags. Ottawa's chief of police Peter Sloly on Wednesday, said his force of 1,500 officers cannot clear the city and may need the help of the nation's military. 'This is a national issue, not an Ottawa issue,' Sloly said. 'I am increasingly concerned there is no policing solution to this. 'There is no lawful authority to seal a city. There's no practical capability to seal a city of this size,' Sloly explained. 'We do not want riots, but all options remain on the table,' he said. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who has re-emereged after going into isolation on Jan. 27 when one of his children tested positive for Covid, said the federal government is working with the Ottawa police to put an end to the protest 'We will continue to work with law enforcement agencies to ensure that people are protected and to ensure that this protest, which is now becoming illegal, does come to an end,' Trudeau said in French in the House of Commons on Wednesday, when asked what the federal government is doing to remove truckers from downtown Ottawa. Sloly warned that bringing in the military would carry a 'massive risk' and calculated that he would need a force of around 50,000 officers in order to move protesters out of the capital. Meanwhile, the blockade ata United States border in southern Alberta seems to be easing up after official truckers blocking access to the border crossing at Coutts agreed to open some blocked lanes. 'Frankly, the protesters feel their message has been heard,' saidChad Williamson, a lawyer representing truckers. 'Nobody wants this blockade to happen any more.' Ottawa residents frustrated with the incessant blare of truck horns and traffic gridlock are questioning how police have handled the demonstration from the start. Sloly also said there is a 'significant element' of the protest's funding and organization coming from the United States. 'It is a local destination, a provincial demonstration, a national demonstration, and one that has international elements associated to it,' Sloly added. On the streets, supporters of the Freedom Convoy are said to have been handing out free food to anyone who needs it. According to one of the volunteers, much of it has been donated by locals. 'The freedom convoy truckers are providing free meals for the homeless in Ottawa. Yet the media and Justin Trudeau turn a blind eye to this. It's an inconvenient truth for them,' James Melville tweeted. How the truckers were funding themselves was made cleared on Wednesday night after a fundraising page set up by the convoy was suddenly shut down. Organizers were told they needed to explain how themillions of dollars raised funds would be spent. On Monday, GoFundMe said that they were satisfied in the explanations given. 'Money raised will be dispersed to our Truckers to aid them with the cost of the journey. Funds will be spent to help cover the cost of fuel for our Truckers first and foremost, will be used to assist with food if needed and contribute to shelter if needed,' the page details. GoFundMe explained their latest suspension in a blog post. 'Recent events in Ottawa, Canada, have generated widespread discussion about the Freedom Convoy 2022 fundraiser on GoFundMe. We wanted to provide clarity around the actions that our global Trust & Safety and Customer Care teams take every day, just as they have with the Freedom Convoy fundraiser,' GoFundMe wrote 'As the activity surrounding the protest evolves, we have been monitoring the fundraiser to ensure the funds are going to the intended recipients and that the fundraiser remains within our Terms of Service. Our monitoring includes maintaining close communication with the organizer as well as collaborating with local law enforcement,' GoFundMe said. Thousands of protesters descended on Ottawa over the weekend, deliberately blocking traffic around Parliament Hill. Police estimate the protest involved 8,000 to 15,000 people Saturday, but has since dwindled to several hundred. But trucks were still blocking traffic. 'We are now aware of a significant element from the United States that have been involved in the funding, the organizing and the demonstrating. 'They have converged on our city and there are plans for more to come,' Ottawa Police Chief Peter Sloly said. The numbers of protesters are falling on the capital's streets but they have vowed to stay put until all vaccine mandates and restrictions are removed. 'Can you be clear about what you mean?' asked one reporter that was present at the briefing. 'That is alarming to people, and I'd like to hear what we're talking about when we say that.' Sloly said that various options were being considered including everything 'available to us within the legal bounds from negotiation through to court injunction through to an enforced removal,' he said. 'When you say 'other than police,' do you mean politics? Do you need military? I don't understand the answer. I understand it's not only police, but then what are those other options that are not police options that we might need?' the reporter asked. 'I think you just listed most of them right there,' Sloly replied. 'Increasingly, as we see demonstrations, not just here, but elsewhere in the country, where there are efforts by strictly a policing action, we are not as confident as we have been that police alone will resolve this situation substantially, never mind in totality. 'Mixing military into a population in the downtown core in a highly volatile demonstration ... may mitigate some risks and may create and escalate a whole bunch of other risks.' Organizers, including one who has espoused white supremacist views, raised millions for the cross-Canada 'freedom truck convoy' against vaccine mandates. There was a public GoFundMe page. Many Canadians have been angered by some of the crude behavior of the protesters. Some urinated or parked on the National War Memorial. One danced on the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. A number carried signs and flags with swastikas. The most visible contingent of protesters were truck drivers who parked their big rigs on Parliament Hill. Some of them were protesting a rule that took effect Jan. 15 requiring truckers entering Canada to be fully immunized against the coronavirus. The Canadian Trucking Alliance has estimated that 85% of truckers in Canada are vaccinated. The protesting truckers also have received praise from former U.S. President Donald Trump and tweets of support from Tesla billionaire Elon Musk. The demonstration began as a move to force the Liberal government of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to drop a vaccine mandate for cross-border truckers. It has since turned into a more populist anti-Trudeau movement. 'We understand your frustration ... but the responsibility for your inconvenience lies squarely on the shoulders of politicians,' protest leader Chris Barber said in a statement to Ottawa residents. 'We are here and we are not going anywhere until we achieve our objective, to see an end of all COVID-19 mandates and with that a restoration of freedoms of all Canadians,' he said. Meanwhile, 2,000 miles across the country insouthern Alberta, truckers are still blocking theCanada-U.S. border with Montana but there are signs of a move towards resolving the protest blockade. The truckers, which have been in place since Saturday, are essentially in a standoff with the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) over the vaccine mandates. The RCMPmoved in on truckers blockading the U.S. border at the town of Coutts but pulled back after clashes with some drivers. Chad Williamson, a lawyer representing truckers blocking access to the crossing at Coutts, Alberta, said they spoke with police and agreed to open some blocked lanes. RCMP Corporal Curtis Peters said there were indications that the lane openings might only be temporary. The tie-up stranded travelers and cross-border truckers for days. Police tried to peacefully break up the demonstration on Tuesday, but demonstrators breached a nearby checkpoint. Alberta premier, Jason Kenney, has condemned the 'unlawful' blockades, calling on protesters to disband and return home. He told reporters people sympathetic with the protests had assaulted police. 'Without hesitation, I condemn those actions and I call for calm amongst anybody who feels sympathetic to those engaged in this blockade,' said Kenney."
6,Georgetown Law is accused of hypocrisy after firing prof who tweeted Biden's SCOTUS nominee would not be the best pick but a 'lesser Black woman' - after failing to sanction staffer who said students should not clerk for Trump judges,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10470655/Georgetown-Law-accused-hypocrisy-firing-professor-disapproved-Bidens-SCOTUS-nominee.html,"Georgetown Law has been accused of having a double standard when it comes to disciplinary action against faculty after it placed one professor one leave for criticizing Joe Biden but not another who took a shot at Donald Trump. Newly hired Ilya Shapiro, who was placed on administrative leave ahead of his February 1 start date,drew outrage from the student body and other Twitterusersover his apparent suggestion that the best Supreme Court nomineeto replace Justice Stephen Breyer could not be a black woman. 'Objectively best pick for Biden is Sri Srinivasan, who is solid prog & v smart [sic],' he tweeted.'Even has identify politics benefit of being first Asian (Indian) American.But alas doesn't fit into the latest intersectionality hierarchy so we'll get lesser black woman. Thank heaven for small favors?' However, the university neglected to take action against law professorHeidi Li Feldman in 2020 after she took to Twitter arguing 'law professors and law school deans' should 'not support applications from our students to clerk for' judges appointed by former President Donald Trump. She also said working'for such a judge indelibly marks a lawyer as lacking in the character and judgment necessary for the practice of law.' Political reporterAaron Sibariumnow argues the prestigious university allows left-leaning professors 'an immunity that is not afforded to right-leaning professors' such as Shapiro. Sibarium alleged that although Feldman's tweet appeared to violate the school and city's non-discrimination policies prohibiting discrimination and harassment based on political affiliation, she remains employed. He added: 'There is no record of any administrative action being taken against her.' Meanwhile, more than 170 university faculty members signed a letter issuing their support for Shapiro and arguing his firing - which several students have called for - would be 'contrary to basic academic freedom principles' that Georgetown applies to the entire academic community. Shapiro is currently on leave while the university conducts an internal investigation into whether he violated any school policies, despite not being employed by the establishment at the time he made the insensitive remarks. 'Ilya Shapiro's tweets are antithetical to the work that we do here every day to build inclusion, belonging and respect for diversity,' Dean Bill Treanor wrote in a letter to the law school community. He added that Shapiro's words were 'appalling' and 'demeaning' words were 'at odds with everything' the law school stands for. However, Sibarium is now questioning the school's decision, citing a 2018 situation in which the university claimed school policy doesn't prohibit the expression of controversial ideas. According to the reporter, in 2018 security studies professor Christine Fair argued supporters of Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation 'deserve miserable deaths while feminists laugh as they take their last gasps'. She also said afterwards people should 'castrate their corpses and feed them to swine'. Although Twitter temporarily suspended Fair's account, the university reportedly took no action against her. In fact, at the time, a Georgetown spokesperson told Fox News: 'Our policy does not prohibit speech based on the person presenting ideas or the content of those ideas, even when those ideas may be difficult, controversial or objectionable.' Disciplinary action was taken against Shapiro after his controversial tweet, despite the fact that helater tweeted an apology, saying: 'I meant no offense, but it was an inartful tweet. I have taken it down.' Shapiro was hired to join Georgetown's law faculty as executive director of the Georgetown Center for the Constitution but now his position is in doubt. On Monday, Shapiro tweeted his confidence that following an investigation by the university he will be allowed to take up his posting in full. 'I'm optimistic that Georgetown's investigation will be fair, impartial, and professional, though there's really not much to investigate. And I'm confident that it will reach the only reasonable conclusion: my Tweet didn't violate any university rule or policy, and indeed is protected by Georgetown policies on freeexpression. Accordingly, I expect to be vindicated and look forward to joining my new colleagues in short order,' he wrote. Biden announced last week that he'd fulfill his campaign promise to nominate the first black female justice as Justice Stephen Breyer said he would retire. The 83-year-old liberal is the oldest member of the bench. On Friday, Georgetown University's Black Law Students Association had demanded his job offer be rescinded, describing the tweet as'offensive, racist, sexist, and misogynistic.' 'The tweets' suggestion that the best Supreme Court nominee could not be a black woman and their use of demeaning language are appalling,' Georgetown University said in a statement. 'The tweets are at odds with everything we stand for at Georgetown Law and are damaging to the culture of equity and inclusion that Georgetown Law is building every day.' On Friday, Shapiro made his first apology, saying:'I regret my poor choice of words, which undermined my message that nobody should be discriminated against for his or her skin color.' 'While it's important that a wide variety of perspectives and backgrounds be represented in the judiciary, so blatantly using identity politics in choosing Supreme Court justices is discrediting to a vital institution. 'Chief Judge Sri Srinivasan is, in my mind, the most qualified nominee a Democratic president could choose. Reasonable people can disagree on that particular assessment, but it's a shame that he and other men and women of every race are excluded from the outset of the selectionprocess,' he explained. Shapiro also penned something similar in an apology that was sent directly into the inboxes of the Georgetown community. 'In seeking to join the Georgetown community, I wanted to contribute to your worthy mission to educate students, inform the public, and engage in the battle of legal ideas that lead to justice and fairness. I still want to do that. Recklessly framed tweets like this week's obviously don't advance that mission, for which I am also truly sorry. Regardless of whether anyone agrees or disagrees with me on a host of legal and policy issues, I can and will do better with regard to how I communicate my positions,' he wrote. Some free speech activists have thrown their support behind Shapiro. 'Academic freedom protects Shapiro’s views, regardless of whether we agree with them or not,' wrote the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education, an advocacy group that focuses on First Amendment issues. 'And debate about the president’s nomination, and about whether race and sex play a proper role in such nominations more generally, would be impoverished — at Georgetown and elsewhere — if this view could not be safely expressed in universities,' the group wrote in a letter. Shapiro will remain off theGeorgetown campus while the investigation takes place."
7,"A REAL limousine liberal: Democrat Amy Klobuchar spent campaign funds on a LA LIMO service and more than $5,000 for a ritzy bash at the Beverly Hills Hilton, FEC records reveal",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10470639/Amy-Klobuchar-spent-campaign-funds-LA-LIMO-service-5-000-Beverly-Hills-Hilton.html,"A 'folksy' midwestern senator used campaign cash to try out the lifestyle of Hollywood's rich and famous last year, campaign records show. Minnesota's Amy Klobuchar divulged in her most recent filings that she spent over $5,000 in campaign donations at the Beverly Hills Hilton and an additional $772 on a limousine company as she attended a November political fundraiser hosted at the home of Chrissy Teigen and John Legend. The liberal celebrity duo reportedly raised over $1 million that night on behalf of the Democrat Senatorial Campaign Committee. One guest told The Hollywood Reporter that Teigen and Legend stressed the importance of the next Senate election cycle, particularly with regard to protecting voting rights. Klobuchar charged her campaign $1,057.61 at the Beverly Hilton on Nov. 5 and another $4099.21 on Nov. 8. Filings also showed a $772.50 charge to MG Limousine in Los Angeles on Nov. 8. The charges were first reported by the Washington Free Beacon. The Beverly Hilton is a famously posh hotel which invites its guests to 'stay among the stars.' It is best known for hosting the Golden Globe Awards, and pricing ranges from $400 a night for a standard room to $4,500 a night for a suite. Five Democratic senators attended the soiree, as did a star-studded cast of actors and entertainment moguls. Klobuchar, Corey Booker, Alex Padilla, Gary Peters and Ron Wyden each gave a few moments of remarks followed by a half-hour piano performance by Legend. About 120 people were present, including actor Sterling K. Brown, Karlie Kloss, Katie Perry, Kerry Washington and Julia Louis-Dreyfuss. Klobuchar has long hob-knobbed with the Teigen-Legend family, the trio pictured smiling in a Vanity Fair photo in 2015. The senator came to Teigen and Legend's defense when Donald Trump called Legend a 'boring musician' and Teigen 'his filthy-mouthed wife.' But Klobuchar over the years has worked to cultivate an 'approachable, folksy demeanor,' political insiders say. 'If you knew her 20 years ago you wouldn't say, 'That's a folksy person.' She's really worked at it,' Larry Jacobs, a political scientist at the University of Minnesota, said in 2019. 'It's genuine, it's not a put-on. But she's also been very conscious of creating an aura around herself of, 'oh, shucks.' And the humor thing, too.' In a 2018 New York Times profile on her presidential prospects by Sheryl Stolberg remarked on her 'aw-shucks-I’m-just-like-you persona' and her 'folksy persona.' But despite the 'Minnesota nice' public image, Klobuchar has been widely rumored to mistreat and berate her staff. Ex-aides have said Klobuchar would occasionally throw office supplies, including binder and telephones, at them in frustration. Some say the senator would make them do tasks that were not part of their job requirement, like wash her dishes or pick up her dry cleaning. Klobuchar would also fire off angry late-night emails and phone calls over minor errors, it has been alleged. In one particularly crude incidentthe New York Times reported in 2019 Klobuchar reportedly berated a staff member who didn't have a fork for her to eat her salad with, at the salad with a comb, then forced the staffer to clean the comb."
8,Tucker Carlson lashes Baltimore schools for defending poor student test scores and the mayor for calling him RACIST after host said democracy is failing in the crime-riddled Democrat run city,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10470855/Test-scores-dont-define-students-Baltimore-schools-fire-Tucker-Carlson.html,"Fox News host Tucker Carlson swatted away excuses from the Baltimore school system and name-calling by the city's mayor as he again took the Democrat-run bastion to task for letting down its students and its citizens. 'Last night we dared to tell you about the ongoing tragedy of the city of Baltimore, one of the great American cities,' Carlson said on Wednesday. 'A city filled with people in total misery, a city people being murdered and children who can't read.' He noted that the mayor of Baltimore, Brandon Scott, responded angrily to his segment. 'We don't have any room for racist vitriol in our city or time for comments that don't contribute towards building a better Baltimore,' tweeted Scott, 37. 'I remain focused on reversing the deep-rooted systemic inequities that have plagued our communities for longer than Tucker Carlson has been alive.' Carlson replied that there was 'no definition of exactly why they are angry at us, because we told the truth.' The Baltimore schools system defended their teaching after Carlson singled outPatterson High School, where 77 percent of students were reading at an elementary level. On Wednesday, the school district insisted that the scores cited were not the only marker of achievement for their students. They said that the tests, taken in September 2021, were intended to help teachers assess the level of students after over a year of remote learning. 'i-Ready scores do not provide a complete or final picture of student performance,' the schools said. 'City Schools uses i-Ready to provide checkpoints on student progress during the school year. 'This was the first in-person checkpoint for students at Patterson High School after 18 months of disruption caused by the pandemic.' They also emphasized that 40 percent of the students did not have English as their first language, and would in further tests be given special consideration. Carlson maintained that his report into the 'misery' of Baltimore was valid. 'The kids can't read, more people are being murdered in Baltimore than ever in its history, people have allowed this to happen,' he said Wednesday. 'They didn't like it when we called them out for it last night.' Tucker was joined by Fox colleague Trace Gallagher during the segment. 'So far no definition of exactly why they are angry at because we told the truth.It is a disgrace letting black people die and calling me racist if I pointed it out,' Carlson said. 'That is not going to work anymore, pal.'  Trace Gallagher told him: 'What they are saying is you didn't do your homework. 'But you were saying last night the test scores have dropped dramatically. 'And the Baltimore schools came back with this, saying that test scores don't define the students. 'But they failed to explain what does define students, considering test scores are a widely used barometer of students' ability. 'They went on to say you criticize them for being limiting or stopping of arresting students who commit crimes and their response to that was they arrest students who commit crimes when it's appropriate, but again they didn't define what exactly is appropriate.' On Tuesday night, Carlson said democracy in the U.S. was failing under Democrats and that the proof was in Baltimore, which has embraced progressive criminal justice policies yet continues to have one of the highest murder rates in the nation. Carlson mocked recent conversations about democracy being in danger and instead said the real danger was whenDemocrats focus on issues like race and climate change rather than on the safety issues facing cities like Baltimore, which has seen more than 300 homicides a year since 2015. Carlson called Baltimore 'one of the worst places in the western hemisphere'. The city reported 32 murders in 2022. 'That's the deadliest January in Baltimore in nearly 50 years and remember, fifty years ago, Baltimore was almost twice as big as it is now,' Carlson said. The city's population shrank from nearly one million residents in the 1970s to about 580,000 in 2020, according to the U.S. Census. 'Half the city is left. So Baltimore is far worse off than it has ever been in its history.' He added that 'Baltimore is exactly what happens when you apply Jen Psaki's ideas to governing. 'Baltimore is a city run by people who fervently believe in the equity agenda and consider gender studies a legitimate academic discipline. In Baltimore, pretty much everyone in charge is black, yet it's a matter of religious faith that the main thing holding the city back is white racism.' Carlson said the high crime rate could be partially attributed to Baltimore's District Attorney, Marilyn Mosby, 41, who announced last year that she would stop prosecuting people for drug possession, prostitution, minor traffic violations and other low-level offenses. Mosby has been under fire herself, and in January she wascharged with perjury for allegedly lying about financial hardship when she withdrew $81,000 from her 401k under the Cares Act to buy two new holiday homes in Florida. But critics have hit back at Carlson, saying that he was being racist toward a predominantly back city and comparing it to Haiti. David Simon, creator of the hit series 'The Wire,' which was based in Baltimore, tweeted: 'Here now at a bar on Aliceanna Street with some friendly neighbors where we are presently sticking pins in a Tucker Carlson doll. Doll seems to like it a bit too much in its nether regions.' One Twitter user named Caroline Orr Bueno wrote: 'The reason Tucker Carlson (and Trump, etc) keep trashing Baltimore is because it has a large black population. It's really that simple.' Another Twitter user with the handle name GusstheLawyer agreed and criticized Carlson for ignoring the nation's racially-charge policies in the past, writing: 'Baltimore has black people in it so it must be compared to a struggling predominantly Black nation. Fun fact, the causes of trouble in both places are directly tied to racist US policy.' Jonathan McIntosh, another Twitter user who grew up in Baltimore wrote: 'Baltimore is also a majority Black city, but I'm sure that's not at all the exact reason Tucker hates it.' Carlson's comments also echoed those of Donald Trump in 2019, when the former president called Baltimore a 'rodent infested mess' where 'no human being would want to live,' and that it was 'worse than Honduras.' Throughout his segment, Carlson also repeatedly took jabs at Joe Biden and Press Secretary Jen Psaki, who he said were more preoccupied in the current conflict at the Ukraine-Russian border than on the safety of Americans at home. It also comes after Psaki said that those who are worried about 'soft-on-crime policies' are living 'in an alternate universe.' 'Hey, Jen Psaki, what do you think of Baltimore? How did the city get that way,' Carlson kept asking throughout the show. 'You claim to care so deeply about African-Americans. You never stop talking about that. And yet here is one of the biggest Black majority cities in the United States. Tens of thousands of black people who live in Baltimore are in misery because their kids keep getting murdered.' Baltimore, often ranked high among the cities with highest homicide rates in the nation, had recorded 337 murders in 2021, the highest since 2019, where police reported 348 murders. In January, the city continues to see high violent crime rates as it reported 225 aggravated assaults, 52 shootings, 51 carjackings and 203 robberies. The city also reported 248 burglaries and 978 other cases of property crimes in January. 'Who do you blame for Baltimore? Did white men do this to Baltimore? Was it the patriarchy? Was it structural racism that caused all those murders,' Carlson asked. 'Or, could it be that the real problem with Baltimore is something much more obvious? Could it be that progressive policies designed to 'lift up marginalized communities' in the end destroyed those communities?' Carlson also blamed high crime rates in the city on schools after the Baltimore City School District spent the last decade pushing to reduce the number of student arrests, which dropped from 971 in 2008 to 18 in 2018, according to Fox 45's Project Baltimore. One whistleblower in the district told Fox 45 that the arrests have not gone down because schools were safer, but because police officers have been told not to arrest students even for crimes like burglary and assault. 'I think it's ludicrous and sad,' said one of the whistleblowers. 'You're not teaching people, our kids, that it's not okay to burglarize. It's not okay to have a fight. They should be arrested and processed.' Carlson mocked the policies in Baltimore and said the city and progressives were the only ones to blame for its issues. 'Baltimore is a city run by people who fervently believe in the equity agenda and consider gender studies a legitimate academic discipline,' he said. 'In Baltimore, pretty much everyone in charge is black, yet it's a matter of religious faith that the main thing holding the city back is white racism.'"
9,"Only plausible explanation for mysterious Havana Syndrome that has afflicted dozens of US diplomats around the world is a WEAPON, CIA report finds",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10471011/U-S-Intelligence-officials-say-device-weapon-kind-Havana-Syndrome.html,"U.S Intelligence officials examining Havana Syndrome say the only plausible explanation for a small number of cases is a device or a weapon of some kind. A US intelligence report by a panel of expert scientists pointed to pulsed electromagnetic energy and ultrasound as possible causes for the mysterious Havana Syndrome - an unexplained illness that has long been believed to be caused inadvertently by surveillance equipment or by a mysterious sonic weapon. 'Pulsed electromagnetic energy, particularly in the radiofrequency range, plausibly explains the core characteristics' the new reporton the mysterious illness released on Wednesday said. The report said that devices do exist that could produce the observed symptoms and are effective over hundreds of meters or through walls. 'Sources exist that could generate the required stimulus, are concealable, & have moderate power requirements' the report said. 'Using nonstandard … antennas & techniques, the signals could be propagated w/low loss through air for tens to hundreds of meters...' The scientist said that Havana Syndrome symptoms are'diverse and may be caused by multiple mechanisms' but that a subset of them 'cannot be easily explained by known environmental or medical conditions'. The scientist added that the while the symptoms are common, the combination of the four core characteristics is 'distinctly unusual and unreported elsewhere in the medical literature, and so far have not been associated with a specific neurological abnormality,' and make it unlikely to be just a typical neurological disorder. The officials who briefed reporters Wednesday said there were significant gaps in what the government knows. Among the recommendations the panel has made is standardizing the information collected across U.S. agencies and creating new markers for identifying and caring for what the government calls 'anomalous health incidents.' The U.S. is also looking for ways to protect officers and prevent future cases. While officials who briefed reporters would not specify what protection measures they have recommended, they urged any employee who believes they have been affected to come forward immediately. 'While we don't have the specific mechanism for each case, what we do know is if you report quickly and promptly get medical care, most people are getting well,' one official said. In a statement, Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines and CIA Director William Burns said the U.S. government 'remains committed to providing access to care for those who need it, and we will continue to share as much information as possible with our workforce and the American public as our efforts continue.' Symptoms of Havana Syndrome include loud noise, ear pain, intense head pressure or vibration, dizziness, visual problems, and cognitive difficulties, and many still continue to experience these or other health problems, according to a 2020 National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicinereport. The report assessed the symptoms to be 'consistent with the effects of directed, pulsed radio frequency (RF) energy.' Some have reported hearing a loud noise before the sudden onset of symptoms. The problem has been labeled the 'Havana Syndrome,' because the first cases affected personnel in 2016 at the U.S. Embassy in Cuba. At least 200 cases across the government are now under investigation. People who are believed to have been affected have reported headaches, dizziness and symptoms consistent with concussions, with some requiring months of medical treatment. Some have reported hearing a loud noise before the sudden onset of symptoms. Countries its been reported in:Cuba, United States, China, Russia, Vietnam, Austria, Germany, Serbia, United Kingdom, Georgia, Poland, Taiwan, Australia, Colombia, Kyrgyzstan, and Uzbekistan Symptoms include: -hearing loss -severe headaches -memory issues -dizziness -brain injury But it's unclear if victims sustain any neurological damage or any longterm damage and it's unclear what might have caused that damage. Some doubt its existence, however, and call it 'mass hysteria.' The leading theory behind the cause of the suddenly surfaced syndrome starts with a device that scientists say Russia could have invented during the Cold War, which was later used to spy on US embassies by collecting data from laptops and cell phones. However, experts now theorize that a hostile country - like Russia or China - may have turned this microwave technology into a weapon. Both countries deny any involvement in any of the incidents relating to the mysterious syndrome. Last montha CIA task force said that the illness is not the product of a sustained global campaign by a hostile power aimed at hundreds of U.S. diplomats and spies. The task force made the assessment that not all of the cases were caused by a hostile power, but said12 cases originating in the embassy in 2016 remain unexplained. Many were caused by 'anomalous health' contributors, it said. The task force also didn't rule out that at least some of the cases may have been an attack. 'This finding does not -- it does not -- call into question the fact that our officers are reporting real experiences and are suffering real symptoms, nor does it explain every report,' a senior CIA official told CNN. There have been roughly 200 reported cases of the yet unexplained illness, colloquially named for its first reported case in 2016 at the US Embassy in Havana, Cuba. Almost half of the cases involved CIA officers or their relatives, nearly 60 have been linked to Department of Defense workers or relatives, and about 50 involved State Department personnel the outlet reported. Back in September, Vice President Kamala Harris' departure from Singapore during her Asia trip was delayed by more than three hours because of an 'anomalous health incident in Hanoi,' which was the next stop in her Asia trip. That was a reference to Havana Syndrome."
10,Susan Sarandon is slammed for calling crowds of cops gathered for slain NYPD officer's funeral FASCISTS and saying that procession was proof that 'cops aren't needed',https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10469911/Susan-Sarandon-SLAMMED-comparing-cops-gathered-slain-NYPD-officers-funeral-fascists.html,"Oscar-winning actress Susan Sarandon sparked fury on social media on Tuesday when she compared mourning cops at an NYPD officer's funeral to fascists. On the eve of Wilbert Mora's funeral, she tweeted a picture of last week's funeral procession on Fifth Avenue for his slain partnerJason Rivera with the caption:'I'm gonna tell my kids this is what fascism looks like.' Above that photo, flames surrounded a question: 'So, if all these cops weren't needed for CRIME that day, doesn't that mean they aren't needed ANY day?' Rivera and his partner Wilbert Mora, 27, were shot dead in East Harlem while responding to a domestic call earlier this month. On Wednesday, hours after Sarandon posted the controversial tweet, an equally-large turnout of officers gathered for Mora's funeral. Twitter users turned out en masse, too, to lambaste the 75-year-old Thelma and Louise actress's post. 'You are disgusting!! We need police officers, we absolutely DON'T need worthless ""actors/actresses"" like you! So pathetic to disrespect the fallen officers and their families. You should be next on the ""cancel culture"" list!!' wrote @EOdell17. 'People who say “cops don’t prevent crime” have to be some of the most naive people of all time,' wrote @stevesbromike. 'Every single city that has defunded their police has seen a sharp rise in almost all crimes. If you don’t think that’s correlated you are literally just stupid.' 'Honestly, what is wrong with you? Do you have any idea the nightmare that is NYC right now? New Yorkers are terrified by the surge of crime, all because of people like you thinking abolishing the police is would solve anything,' wrote another user. 'It [is] the logic of a three-year-old,' wrote another user. 'I suggest she does the duties of a cop for a year and then let's see how fascist she thinks they are. Cops protect little children, rescue those in distress and vulnerable everywhere. All she does it talk for a living.' The actress, who lived in the Chelsea neighborhood for three decades until 2020, has been historically critical of the NYPD. After she sold her huge pre-war duplex for $7.9 million, the actress told the Wall Street Journal that she intended to stay in the neighborhood and always remain a New Yorker. In July of this year, Sarandon joined a rally outside Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's office calling for 'Medicare for All,' saying that she and her fellow leftists are 'losing hope' in the progressive lawmaker through a bullhornand calling for better leadership from 'The Squad.' In 2018, Sarandon was arrested alongside 575 other protesters during an demonstration outside the US Senate building against a Trump-era policy that separated migrant children from their parents at the border. Nearly a decade earlier, she was arrested in March of 1999 outside One Police Plaza after she joined a several-week-long protest after Amadou Diallo, a unarmed street vendor, was shot dead by NYPD cops in the Bronx. Speaking to Sydney's Saturday Extra, the actress admitted that year that she wasn't one to shy away from controversy after expressing her staunchly negative opinion on Hillary Clinton during the last US presidential campaign and having her say on the #MeToo movement in light of the Harvey Weinstein scandal. However, the Academy Award winner, 71, has admitted that her strong views came at a price - leaving her shunned from people in the industry and even receiving death threats. 'The things that I regret are only things I didn’t say or do, even though I went through a pretty scary time leading up to Iraq, and I certainly - in not supporting Hillary Clinton - ended up getting an enormous amount of heat about that. The Thelma and Louise star continued: 'I just know for all the unkind or hurtful things, or scary things that have happened because of an unpopular stand with the war or whatever, I don’t regret it.' In 2017, Sarandon announced she was glad Hillary Clinton lost the election because she's 'very dangerous' and America would be 'at war.' When former Mayor de Blasio lauded the NYPD for their 'tremendous restraint overall' during George Floyd protests, Sarandon tweeted 'shame on you' at him. Ultimately, the city Department of Investigation later criticizing cops for their use of excessive force during a number of 2020 protests and de Blasio apologized. Sarandon isn't the first person to get backlash over their gripes regarding the funerals - Coney Island Prep math teacher Christopher Flanigan was fired after he posted a photo of the mass of officers, saying that they were in the 'ideal conditions for reciprocity' for officers that plowed into George Floyd protesters in 2020. Flanigan captioned the now-deleted photo in his Instagram story: '5/30/20: NYPD SUV drives into a crowd of protestors. Ideal conditions for reciprocity,' according to theNew York Post. The now-fired teacher said that his comment was 'misconstrued.' 'I was really just trying to show the vulnerability of all of these police officers being in the same place at the same time which seems like a dangerous situation for anyone that would be that gathered together,' Flanigan told the Poston Sunday. New York Cityactress Jacqueline Guzman was let go from Face to Face Films theater company after ranting about street closures during Rivera's funeral. In a now-deleted TikTok, Guzman pans over street traffic, showing police cars and ambulances blocking streets. 'We do not need to shut down most of Lower Manhattan because one cop died for probably doing his job incorrectly,' she says in the video. 'They kill people who are under 22 every single day for no good reason and we don't shut down the city for them, so.' Her own company released a statement, calling Guzman's video 'insensitive' and that it does not 'condone' her 'comments made about fallen Officer Rivera.' Although Guzman's post drew an incredible amount of ire, some Twitter users today still griped about the traffic caused by Mora's funeral procession. 'Traffic in midtown is insane today because of the NYPD officer’s funeral,' wrote @adammc123. 'Cars are blowing through intersections on red lights. I almost got hit twice & yelled at drivers. Some guy on Broadway was having a MELTDOWN at a truck blocking the intersection. I don’t blame him!' 'In case anyones having a bad day: I got stuck on 7th ave for two hours because of an NYPD funeral and then my power steering died so I then had to wait for a tow for another two hours while they navigated the same traffic,' wrote @NEZ2021."
11,"3,500 flights will be canceled across the US Thursday as powerful winter storm slams into Midwest and the Northeast: 78% of flights out of St. Louis and 38% of flights from Chicago were grounded Wednesday ",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10470815/More-3-600-flights-cancelled-Thursday-powerful-winter-storm.html,"Over 3,600 flights within the US are set to be canceled tomorrow as the country deals with snow, sleet and freezing rain from a powerful winter storm that has closed schools and led multiple governors to declare states of emergency. On Wednesday, there were nearly 3,500 delays and2,365 cancellations across the country, with airports in the Midwest being hit particularly hard, according to flight tracking website FlightAware. 'A large, prolonged and significant winter storm will continue to impact much of the central US and move into the Northeast overnight, bringing a variety of winter weather hazards including heavy snow, sleet and freezing rain,' the National Weather Service said Wednesday night. The governors of Kentucky and Missouri have declared a state of emergency, whileIllinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker issued a disaster declaration. On Wednesday, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul directed state agencies to prepare emergency plans before the storm hits the state on Thursday. The storm is expected to continue affecting air travel through the week. Already, 3,624 flights scheduled for Thursday have been canceled, while 363 flights set for Friday also being axed. The airports that have been affected the most are all within the winter storm's path, mostly in the Midwest and parts of the South. At St. Louis Lambert International, 78 percent of flights were cancelled Wednesday. At Chicago O'Hare, 37 percent were cancelled. In Springfield, Missouri, 35 percent of flights were cancelled. Thirty percent were axed in Kansas City, Missouri. The blast of frigid weather, which began arriving Tuesday night, put a long stretch of states from New Mexico and Colorado to Maine under winter storm warnings and watches. On Wednesday morning, Oklahoma, Kansas, Missouri, Illinois, Indiana and Michigan saw freezing rain, sleet and snow. The snow affected residents as far south as Texas, where multiple school districts in the Dallas-Fort Worth area announced they were cancelling classes Thursday and Friday, according to the Dallas Morning News. Schools in central Texas, including Austin, also announced closures, according to KXAN. On Tuesday, Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt tweeted that the state's Department of Transportation 'has more than 500 trucks statewide to respond to the storm and 123,000 tons of salt and sand.' Missouri Gov. Mike Parson declared a state of emergency, with more than half the state under a winter storm warning. By midday Wednesday, some places had already reported snow totals exceeding or nearing a foot, including the central Illinois town of Lewistown with 14.4 inches and the northeastern Missouri city of Hannibal with 11.5 inches. About a third of Americans are under a winter watch, warning or advisory, according to the National Weather Service. 'While heavy snow is expected from the Rockies to New England, significant ice accretions will be likely on the storm's southern edge from TX to central PA,' the NWS said Tuesday. In Colorado, residents woke up to heavy snowfall Wednesday, with 11 inches in communities around Denver and 22 inches in the Colorado Springs area, the weather service said. On Wednesday, Eleanor Kasper and her 5-year-old son, Eli, took the snow day as an opportunity to sled down a hill in Middle Shooks Run Park in Colorado Springs, Colorado. Multiple schools closed downdue to weather in the Colorado Springs area. Parts of Missouri, Illinois and Ohio could receive 12 to 18 inches of snow through Thursday, the National Weather Service said, according to the Wall Street Journal. Central Illinois and northern Indiana appeared likely to receive the most snowfall, with expected totals ranging from 12 to 18 inches by the end of Thursday, said Andrew Orrison, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in College Park, Maryland. In Chicago, Elisha Waldman and his sons welcomed the opportunity to hit a sledding hill Wednesday morning, even as snow continued to fall. 'Cold and wet and wonderful, and getting cold and wet is part of the fun with the guys, and we get to go inside and have hot cocoa and warm up,' Waldman said. Gov.Pritzker of Illinois issued adisaster declaration Tuesday afternoon. About 130 members of the Illinois National Guard were activated to combat heavy snow, ice and 'blizzard conditions' over the next few days, according WMAQ. 'I'm authorizing a disaster proclamation for Winter Storm Landon, effective immediately, to support local government disaster response and recovery operations wherever necessary. I want to assure county and local officials and everyone in the path of the storm that my administration will provide resources every step of the way,' Pritzker said. 'On the ground, all state assets stand ready to assist. I encourage everyone to do what you can to stay safe: listen to local authorities to stay up to date with the latest conditions in your community and make sure your household has essentials.' The Illinois Department of Transportation will send out more than 1,800 trucks and equipment to plow and treat roads and to respond to weather-related emergencies, officials said. In Detroit's western suburbs, Tony Haley also found an advantage to the weather. He owns a landscaping and irrigation company that offers snow removal and salting services, but the early winter weeks offered few opportunities for business. 'This one here, we're looking for a good two, three days of work,' Haley said after clearing snow away from several businesses in Canton. But for those on the roads, the heavy snow created hazardous conditions. 'We're receiving a lot of snow over here in northwest Indiana and it's the wet, slushy snow that causes treacherous driving conditions to say the least,' Indiana State Police Sgt. Glen Fifield told WFLD-TV. In central Missouri, officials shut down part of Interstate 70 midday after a crash made the roadway impassable. Areas south of the heavy snow were expected to see freezing rain, with the heaviest ice predicted along the lower Ohio Valley area from Louisville, Kentucky, to Memphis, Tennessee. 'If everything holds to where it is right now, this is the real deal,' said Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, who ordered state government offices to close on Thursday. 'It is dangerous. People need to be prepared. 'A damaging ice storm is likely from eastern Arkansas northeastward to western Kentucky,' the National Weather Service said Wednesday. 'This will likely result in power outages, tree damage, and dangerous travel conditions. A broader corridor of heavy ice accumulations is likely from Texas through the Ohio River Valley.' The disruptive storm moved across the central US on Groundhog Day, the same day the famed groundhog Punxsutawney Phil predicted six more weeks of winter. The storm came on the heels of a nor'easter last weekend that brought blizzard conditions to many parts of the East Coast."
12,"Canada's state broadcaster spreads bizarre conspiracy theory that 'Russian actors' are behind 50,000-strong 'Freedom Convoy' of truckers protesting Justin Trudeau's vaccine mandate",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10468751/CBC-spreading-conspiracy-theory-Russian-actors-trucker-vaccine-mandate-protests.html,"Canada's state broadcaster, the Canadian Broadcasting Company, is spreading a bizarre and unfounded conspiracy theory that 'Russian actors' are behind the 'Freedom Convoy' trucker vaccine mandate protests currently being held in Ottawa and at the US border. During a broadcastFriday on the CBC - which is funded by the Canadian government - anchor Nil Koksal offered Parliament member Marco Mendicino the theory, citing the country's current relationship with the Ukraine, a former Soviet nation currently at odds with Russia, as evidence. 'Given Canada's support of Ukraine, in this current crisis with Russia, I don't know if it's far-fetched to ask,' Koksal told Mendicino, the county's minister of public safety, during the Friday interview. 'But there is concern that Russian actors could be continuing to fuel things as this protest grows. Perhaps even instigating it from, from the outset.' The Freedom Convoy, a coalition of 50,000 drivers protesting Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's vaccine mandate for cross-border truckers that formed last month, has been described as a grassroots movement and has no known ties to Russia. Protests began in Ottawa last month on January 23 and at the US-Canada border in Alberta on Saturday and are still going strong, despite warnings from Royal Canadian Mounted Police that things will get ugly for revelers if they do not abandon their 'Freedom Convoy' campaign, where tens of thousands of truckers have blocked crucial roads at both locations with their parked vehicles. Trudeau, 50, has refused to meet with the group to discuss their qualms with his new policy, which was put into effect in January and requires Canadian truckers to be vaccinated in order to enter and exit the country on their routes. On Tuesday, after four days of protests, police threatened to arrest truckers blockading the US border in Alberta unless they leave the area immediately. Scroll down for video During Tuesday's interview, Mendicino seemed to deflect Koksal's incredulous question. 'I'm going to defer to our partners in the public safety of trained officials and experts in that area,' the official said during the interview, which was held remotely. 'What I can tell you is that we do have courses on site right now who are watching the conduct of this convoy very carefully. And we're providing direction and guidance to residents to ensure that there is a peaceful protest but, at the same time, providing direction and guidance to residents,' Medocino added. Koksal's comments quickly set off a storm of backlash on social media, with users criticizing the longtime CBC fixture for offering an unfounded theory based entirely on speculation as news. 'Journalistic malpractice,' one user tweeted Saturday, the day after Koksal's brazen declaration. 'This movement is just as much about that as anything else. We wouldn't be here if they just did their jobs.' Others slammed the longtime CBC News Network anchor for following fellow liberal US President Joe Biden's example of blaming Russia for another nation's problems. 'When in doubt, blame the ever elusive ""Russian actors!""' one user wrote Saturday. 'Liberals have one beat: Russia, Russia, Russia,' another joked. Another compared the state of the media in the northern nation to that of China, a socialist county often accused of curtailing the civil liberties of its 1.4 billion citizens. 'The media in Canada clearly now have no more freedom or wish to report truthfully as the media in China. Laughable story.' 'On a scale of one to ten, how stupid do they think we are?' another stunned poster asked. As of Tuesday morning, a clip of the exchange has garnered more than half-a-million views on Twitter. The strange speculation offered by Koksal - who is paid by the state - comes as a Canadian elected official in Ottawa reportedly deleted a Tweet that outlined a plan to seize funds raised for the truckers through a GoFundMe account, which surpassed the 10,000,000 CAD mark on Wednesday. 'This morning, I have asked the city manager and city solicitor to immediately launch court proceedings targeting the millions of dollars in funds frozen by @GoFundMe so Ottawa taxpayers are not left holding the bag for these protests,' Ottawa City Councilor Mathieu Fleury allegedly tweeted Monday morning, screenshots posted to Twitter reveal. The tweet, however, was deleted before noon that day. As of Wednesday the parliament member's Twitter account was restricted to only allow 'approved followers' to see his tweets, which was not the case at the time of the initial post. It is unclear when exactly Fleury protected the account. What's more, Fleury's website, mathieufleury.ca,does not have a working 'Contact Us' page, and instead shows a 'Page not found' error message. The GoFundMe pagein question surpassed its goal of 10,000,000 CAD as of Wednesday. The sum is roughly half a million CAD more than combined efforts of the major Canadian political parties in the final quarter of 2021. Freedom Convoy organizers BJ Dichter and Tamara Lich say that the proceeds will go towards fuel for the truckers, who have been protesting for five days straight with no sign of stopping despite warning from the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, as well as food and lodgings 'to help ease the pressures of this arduous task.' 'Our current government is implementing rules and mandates that are destroying the foundation of our businesses, industries and livelihoods,' the two wrote on the page. 'We are a peaceful country that has helped protect nations across the globe from tyrannical governments who oppressed their people, and now it seems it is happening here.' Drivers along the border are also raising money through a separate fundraiser spearheaded by Rebel News journalist Ezra Levant, to cover drivers' legal fees if they end up incarcerated. As of Wednesday, Levant has received nearly 9,000 donations. Levant was enlisted by truckers at the Alberta-Montana crossing Monday, after Special Tactical Operations officers sealed off the motorists by setting up police check points around the townCoutts, which boasts a population of less than 500. 'They asked me if we could help them right now,' Levant wrote online to his news outlet Rebel News. 'And I said, ""of course."" I promised them we'd crowdfund a lawyer to fight any tickets or charges they face, no matter how large they may get. 'I promised the truckers we’d take the case and crowdfund it all the way. Even if it takes years in court.' However, Levant and the truckers got their wish sooner rather than later when they saw an influx of funds Tuesday that enabled them to hire renowned civil liberties attorney Chad Williamson. Speaking to RebelNews Tuesday, Calgary-based lawyer revealed that Royal Canadian Mounted Police officials handed members of the so-called 'Freedom Convoy' the ultimatum Tuesday, a day after Trudeau slammed the dissenters for protesting a mandate put on the truckers on January 15. 'The police have essentially shut down all negotiations, period,' Williamson told the outlet Tuesday. 'They have indicated that they got marching orders essentially to reopen the highway.'  'They're not going to discuss anything further with protesters,' the legal eagle added. 'They have indicated that those who leave now are free to do so; those who remain behind run the risk of being arrested.' Williamson went on to explain that the law - at least in Canada - is not on the truckers' side, and that police are ready to play hardball after four full days of protests. 'There's various pieces of legislation and charges that they can essentially lay against people who remain. 'They have indicated that they are going to seize equipment, and they've indicated that they are going to reopen the highway.' The lawyer added that he and his hundred or so clients have elected to take a wait-and-see approach to the RCMP's gambit. 'We provided the standard legal charter advice for folks, and we’re going to see how this plays out. 'We've really tried to stress everyone to remain calm, remain peaceful, no matter what happens, but things are pretty tense.' Williamson's words proved prophetic later that day, when more than a hundred truckers engaged in a bitter stand off with RCMP Special Tactical Operations agents, who were called in to quell the crisis over the weekend. Revelers gathered just off the Alberta-Montana border crossing Tuesday afternoon after they learned the officers would be making arrests, and began egging on officers by repeatedly chanting 'Freedom' as cops looked on. No arrests were made during the protest, which remained peaceful. DailyMail.com reached out to rep for Alberta's RCMP Tuesday to comment on the standoff and the ongoing protests. The force provided a statement, confirming Williamson's remarks. It said: 'What may have begun as a peaceful assembly quickly turned into an unlawful blockade. While the Alberta RCMP has been in a position to conduct enforcement, we have been engaged with protesters at the Coutts border crossing in an effort to find a peaceful and safe resolution for all involved. We thought we had a path to resolution, the protesters eventually chose not to comply. 'As of this morning, further action is being taken by the Alberta RCMP as this blockade continues to impede the ability for emergency agencies to provide full services to area residents. It has also negatively impacted the flow of goods and services, and impedes the public’s freedom of movement.' It continued: 'A Highway is considered essential infrastructure. It is unlawful to willfully obstruct, interrupt or interfere with the construction, maintenance, use or operation of any essential infrastructure in a manner that renders the essential infrastructure dangerous, useless, inoperative or ineffective as per the Critical Infrastructure Defence Act of Alberta. 'Anyone who actively blocks a highway—or aids, counsels or directs a highway to be blocked—may be subject to arrest and charge under this act.' But the truckers seemed undeterred by the police's warning Wednesday, continuing to set up camp in the town of Coutts despite frigid conditions. Meanwhile, nearly 2,000 miles away in Ottawa - where the protests first began - tens of thousands truckers have been joined by hundreds of other citizens who support their cause. The protests, however, despite rumors circulating online, have remained largely peaceful, according to witnesses, with a Tuesday police statement stating that they have only two non-violent arrests since the protests started on January 23 - one for mischief, and one for carrying a weapon at a public meeting. With that said, the much larger group of truckers camped out in the nation's capital seemed undeterred by police's repeated warnings that they will face legal recourse if they continue to protest, and made themselves comfortable in the city's Downtown neighborhood Wednesday, cooking up pizzas withpair of outdoor wood-powered ovens and handing out hundreds of the freshly cooked meals for free to anyone who asked. The rising tension between the two parties comes as Prime Minister Trudeau - who slammed the truckers Monday during a remote press conference as 'hateful,' 'violent,' and 'racist' and vowed to take action against the coalition - fled his home in Ottawa over the weekend out of fear of the angry mob. Two days later, the politico tested positive for COVID. He is isolating from an undisclosed location. On Monday, the prime minister publicly criticized the tens of thousands Freedom Convoy truckers and protestors in Coutts and Canada's capital, citing their 'hateful rhetoric' and 'violence to fellow citizens.' 'I have also chosen to not go anywhere near protests that have expressed hateful rhetoric, violence toward fellow citizens. And a disrespect, not just of science, but of the frontline health workers and quite frankly, the 90% of truckers who have been doing the right thing to keep Canadians safe, to put food on our tables,' Trudeau said. 'Canadians know where I stand,' he went on. 'This is a moment for responsible leaders to think carefully about where they stand and who they stand with.' 'Canadians were shocked and frankly disgusted by the behavior displayed by some people protesting in our nation's capital,' Trudeau said. Trudeau had called the truckers headed for the city a 'small fringe minority' before the convoy of hundreds of vehicles grew up to 45 miles long, as it made its way to the capital. On Tuesday, a second convoy of truckers protesting the mandates went eyeball-to-eyeball with a SWAT Team at the Alberta-Montana border, and allegedly pressured staff at a nearby homeless shelter to give them food. On Monday,Trudeau declared that he would not be meeting with truckers overrunning Ottawa due to their 'hateful rhetoric,' as hundreds more disgruntled driversthousands of miles away formed a blockade at the southern tip of Alberta to block off traffic to and from the US. Trudeau, 50, held the conference from isolation at an undisclosed location after testing positive for COVID-19 earlier that day. Two of the prime minister's three children also tested positive for the virus. When asked whether he was going to meet the protesters, Trudeau said he had no interest in going 'anywhere near protests who have expressed hateful rhetoric and violence towards their fellow citizens.' The politician went on to assert that he had personally attended protests himself when he 'agreed with the goals' being fought for, such as those championed by Black Lives Matter, but dismissed the truckers' dissent - which was spurred by the politico's own policies - as 'racist' and 'violent.' 'I have attended protests and rallies in the past when I agreed with the goals, when I supported the people expressing their concerns and their issues,' Trudeau said. 'But I have also chosen to not go anywhere near protests that have expressed hateful rhetoric, violence towards fellow citizens, and a disrespect not just of science, but of the frontline health workers and quite frankly, the 90 per cent of truckers who have been doing the right thing to keep Canadians safe to put food on our tables.' Meanwhile, nearly 2,000 miles west, hundreds more protesting truckers have convened at the southernmost point of the province of Alberta, forming a blockade between the territory and the US state of Montana to the south. The double-pronged effort from the coalition of more than 50,000 Canadian truck drivers - which has remained largely peaceful - was spurred by recent policies implemented by Trudeau's office that declared that by January 15, all truckers in the country who are unvaccinated must take aCOVID-19test and quarantine when driving back from the states. Per the progressive politician's new guidance, Canadian drivers who are not vaccinated are barred from entering the US until they have gotten the jab, while American drivers are currently not allowed into Canada unless they produce a certificate proving that they have been inoculated. The policy comes in stark contrast to that of the nation's neighbor the south, with American drivers returning home to the US not required to test and quarantine. During the address, Trudeau conceded that he understood the frustrations of the Canadian people regarding the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic but asserted that some of the behavior seen at the recent protests in the nation's capital, including swastikas, Confederate flags, and the desecrating of memorials, was unacceptable. 'I want to be very clear, we are not intimidated by those who hurl insults and abuse at small business workers, and steal food from the homeless. We won't give in to those who fly racist flags. We won't cave to those who engage in vandalism or dishonor the memory of our veterans.' He added: 'Freedom of expression, assembly, and association are cornerstones of democracy. But Nazi symbolism, racist imagery, and desecration of war memorials are not. It is an insult to memory and truth. Hate can never be the answer.' Trudeau then called on the protesting truckers - and the thousands supporting them - to put a halt to their actions. 'There is no place in our country for threats, violence or hatred,' he asserted. 'So for those responsible for this behavior, it needs to stop. To anyone who joined the convoy and was rightly uncomfortable with the symbols of hatred and division on display, join with your fellow Canadians. Be courageous, and speak out. Do not stand for, or with, intolerance and hate.' In his speech, Trudeau went on to slam conservative politicians from his country for supporting the truckers' protests, warning them to 'think long and hard about the consequences of your actions.' After the address, the prime minister doubled down on his stance in a series of posts on social media. Trudeau's speech, delivered more than 24 hours after the prime minister fled his home in Ottawa as protesters convened on the capital, came as another formidable force of protesters more than 1,800 miles away, in Coutts, Alberta, were met with backlash from local law enforcement, who ordered the drivers Monday to stand down and stop blocking trucks and other international commuters from crossing the currentlygridlocked dividing line, RebelNews reported. After a vote, the outlet reported Monday afternoon, drivers stationed along the border refused to budge, and for now, the border remains closed, despite heavy police presence. Earlier that morning, after fleeing his home with his family Sunday as thousands of truckers descended on the Canadian capital to protest the country's vaccine mandate and COVID lockdowns,Trudeau revealed he had tested positive forCOVID-19. 'This morning, I tested positive for COVID-19,' the woke politician wrote on social media that morning. 'I’m feeling fine – and I’ll continue to work remotely this week while following public health guidelines. Everyone, please get vaccinated and get boosted.' Trudeau, who is vaccinated and has received a booster, is currently self-isolating at an undisclosed location after fleeing with his family from their home in the Canadian city as protesters convened, a four full days after the politician found out he had been exposed to the virus. 'Last night, I learned that I have been exposed to COVID-19,' Trudeau wrote on Twitter Thursday morning. 'My rapid test result was negative. I am following @OttawaHealth rules and isolating for five days. I feel fine and will be working from home. Stay safe, everyone – and please get vaccinated.' The progressive prime minister provided no details on when or how he was exposed to the virus at the time, and his office has since not commented further on his positive test, which he said came early Monday morning. The politico also did not divulge whether or not it was a rapid or PCR test that garnered the positive result, and has not yet updated the public as to his location. Trudeau's revelation comes as the'Freedom Convoy' of trucks - joined by thousands of demonstrators - brought Ottawa to a virtual standstill for a third day on Monday, as they protested the prime minister'svaccine mandates, forcing the prime minister to flee the city with his family due to 'security concerns.' The decision to move the prime minister Saturday was spurred by a warning from the sergeant-at-arms of the Canadian Parliament that protesters might show up at the homes of politicians, CBC reported. The protesting truckers say there is no 'end date' in sight and plan to stay in the capital 'for as long as it takes' and until the Canadian government flips and withdraws its policy on vaccine mandates. By Melissa Koenig A conservative Canadian parliamentarian slammed Prime MinisterJustin Trudeau on Monday as she condemned him for refusing to speak with thousands of truckers demonstrating against the country's vaccine mandate. Speaking before the House of Commons, Canadian MP Candice Bergen reminded her fellow parliamentarians that the prime minister has donned blackface 'more times than he can remember,' after he claimed that the demonstrators in the Freedom Convoy were spreading 'hateful rhetoric.' 'All Canadians want to see a leader who will work to heal riffs, not further divide, a leader who will listen even to those voices he might not agree with, a leader who will work to understand, not dismiss, name-call and gaslight,' Bergen began. 'Contrary to some, there are thousands of passionate, patriotic and peaceful Canadians on the Hill right now who just want to be heard,' she continued. 'Will the prime minister extend an olive branch and will he listen?' Bergen was then interrupted by Minister of Public Safety Marco Mendicino, who asked her to condemn the protesters who allegedly urinated on the country's National War Memorial and used the statue of Canadian athlete Terry Fox to display a sign reading 'Mandate Freedom.' 'Of course we all condemn hateful and destructive acts by a few at any protest,' she responded, going on to list a number of instances in which protesters desecrated public property or displayed hateful symbols, such as blackface or Nazi flags. 'But I'm not talking about that Mr. Speaker,' Bergen said, noting: 'I apologize that that minister is misleading Canadians. 'I do get very defensive of Canadians who are outside today - patriotic, peace-loving Canadians who are called misogynists and racist by the prime minister. 'So again, I ask the prime minister, who may I remind this House wore blackface on more times than he can remember, apologize to the peace-loving, patriotic Canadians who are outside right now just asking to be heard - will he speak to them?' Trudeau had faced controversy in 2019 when photos emerged of him wearing blackface while dressed as Aladdin. In an interview at the time, he said he could not give a definitive number on how many times he had worn blackface. Bergen's comments come after the Canadian prime minister publicly announced he will not be meeting with the truckers who are currently overrunning Ottawa in protest of his vaccine mandate - despite a tweet two years ago praising truck drivers for their work in the early days of the pandemic. 'Over the past few days, Canadians were shocked and frankly, disgusted by the behavior displayed by some people protesting in our nation’s capital,' Trudeau said Monday in a public press conference broadcasted remotely, referring to the unrest in Ottawa, which began on Saturday. Trudeau, 50, held the conference from isolation at an undisclosed location after testing positive for COVID-19 earlier that day. Two of the prime minister's three children also tested positive for the virus. When asked whether he was going to meet the protesters, Trudeau said he had no interest in going 'anywhere near protests that have expressed hateful rhetoric and violence towards their fellow citizens.' The politician went on to assert that he had personally attended protests himself when he 'agreed with the goals' being fought for, such as those championed by Black Lives Matter, but dismissed the truckers' dissent - which was spurred by the politico's own policies - as 'racist' and 'violent.' 'I have attended protests and rallies in the past when I agreed with the goals, when I supported the people expressing their concerns and their issues,' Trudeau said. 'But I have also chosen to not go anywhere near protests that have expressed hateful rhetoric, violence towards fellow citizens, and a disrespect not just of science, but of the frontline health workers and quite frankly, the 90 percent of truckers who have been doing the right thing to keep Canadians safe to put food on our tables.'"
13,How 'caring' Kansas girl went from 'intelligent student who loved science and photography' to machine gun-toting ISIS jihadi who led an all-female battalion in Syria,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10468479/Kansas-woman-charged-joining-ISIS-seen-school-photo-decades-radicalized.html,"The Kansas woman charged with joining the Islamic State group and leading an all-female battalion in Syria was once known as an 'intelligent' and 'caring' student who loved science and photography and had hopes of becoming a school teacher, DailyMail.com has learned. Allison Fluke-Ekren, 42, of Topeka, is accused of providing and conspiring to provide material support to ISIS after joining the terrorist organization overseas in 2014, prosecutors say. Authorities released a booking photo following her arrest Friday, in which she was seen wearing a black hijab, and revealed she was known to go by the names, Umm Mohammed al-Amriki, Umm Mohammed, and Umm Jabril. Photos from her family blog also showed Fluke-Ekren in Islamic dress alongside her second husband Volkan Ekren and young children in the years after they left the US for Egypt in 2008. But former friends and acquaintances have told DailyMail.com the radicalized woman pictured in the photo and now charged with such horrific crimes is a far cry from the 'intelligent' and 'mature' young girl — then known as Allison Brooks — they knew growing up in rural Topeka. Former school teacher-turned-friend Larry Miller remembered Fluke-Ekren as a stellar student at Topeka Collegiate in the early 1990s, who had a keen interest in science, photography and nature, and wanted to become a teacher herself. Smiling and posing with a lizard, wide-eyed and innocent Fluke-Ekren is seen in a photo Miller shared with DailyMail.com,working on a science project in junior high, decades before she would become the leader of an Islamic terrorist group. 'This photo was taken when she was with me and a number of other students and adults on a herpetological research project when she was in probably the eighth grade,' Miller told DailyMail.com Wednesday. 'She loved nature and she loved learning about nature. She had caught this adult Great Plains skink and was showing it to others when I took the photo.' Another picture shows young Fluke-Ekren with a flower tucked behind her ear while posing in a field near Topeka. The photo was takenduring an outdoor photography class that focused on nature and wildlife photography, as well as how to use natural settings for outdoor portraits, said Miller, who taught the course in the 1990s with the help of Fluke-Ekren. Miller said the photos represent the smart and enthusiastic Allison he and many of her old friends in Kansas remember, and that he is shocked as to how one of his former student had ended up leading a life as a terrorist in adulthood. 'I have no doubt that what is now in the news around the world is true of her,' the former teacher said. 'I do not understand, however, just how intelligent and caring people like Allison and others end up being so brainwashed to want to harm and kill others that in most cases, usually all cases, have done nothing to deserve any type of violence toward them. 'Maybe I am just an old man that grew up in a time when this type of thing, even though I know it existed in some areas, was not what it is now.' Miller told local news station KSNTearlier that Fluke-Ekren seemed 'so mature for a seventh-grader' and 'like someone who had it all together.' He said he was 'probably as shocked about anything as I've ever been — and I've had some pretty weird things happen to me in my life.' In an interview with The Capital Journal, he said 'never would any of us who knew her back then ever thought she would end up as she has today.' Miller explained the two had kept in touch over the years, and that Fluke-Ekren even hired him to be her wedding photographer. In 2008 Fluke-Ekren sent him an email, writing to him that she was happily married with four children, and that she was pursuing a Master's degree in teaching in Indiana. Some time after that, she reached out to Miller again, asking him if he knew of any teaching positions in Kansas. Miller said he told her of one job opportunity, to which she applied and was hired, but instead she moved with her second husband and children to Egypt. A former friend identified only as Farouk alsotoldABC News the Fluke-Ekren was 'highly intelligent' and described her as a 'marksman' who 'fantasized' about an attack on the US and who 'liked being in charge.' Fluke-Ekren made an initial appearance on Monday afternoon in U.S. District Court in Alexandria, Virginia. The hearing lasted only minutes; she was ordered to remain in jail pending a detention hearing set for Thursday afternoon, and an attorney was appointed to represent her. At the end of the hearing, though, First Assistant US Attorney Raj Parekh told the judge that he had been in contact with Fluke-Ekren's parents and her adult children, and all had said they wanted no contact with her. The magistrate judge, Ivan Davis, said he had little ability to keep her from reaching out to her family from jail, but told Fluke-Ekren he would take it into account at Thursday's hearing if she contacted her family against their wishes. Fluke-Ekren, speaking in a soft-spoken voice and wearing an inmate jumpsuit and headscarf, said she understood the restriction. She also told the judge, in response to his question, that she preferred to be addressed as Ekren. According to court papers, Fluke-Ekren moved to Egypt in 2008 and traveled frequently between Egypt and the US over the next three years. Fluke-Ekren's final Facebook post, dated May 5, 2008, reads: 'Moving to Egypt. I'm a little behind the curve, but trying to learn how to use Facebook. =-) Well, after years of planning and preparing, we are moving out of the States. We'll be in Cairo, Egypt, insha'Allah. I am teaching kindergarten, and my husband will be going to Al Azhar [University]. The kids are excited, but nervous, as am I. Any prayers would be greatly appreciated!' She has not been in the US since 2011. Prosecutors believe she moved to Syria around 2012. In early 2016, her husband was killed in the Syrian city of Tell Abyad while trying to carry out a terrorist attack, prosecutors said. Later that year, prosecutors say she married a Bangladeshi ISIS member who specialized in drones, but he died in late 2016 or early 2017. Four months after that man's death, she again remarried a prominent Islamic state leader who was responsible for the Islamic State group's defense of Raqqa. She told one witness in 2018 that she instructed a person in Syria to tell Fluke-Ekren's family she was dead so the U.S. government would not try to find her, according to Parekh's memo. 'Fluke-Ekren informed this same witness and others that it was important to kill the kuffar (disbelievers) and die as martyrs on behalf of ISIS in Syria,' the memo alleges. 'The witness also heard Fluke-Ekren state that she never wanted to return to the United States and that she wanted to die in Syria as a martyr.' Photos from a family blog called 4KansasKids show her and her children in the years they traveled between Kansas and Egypt, posing at the base of the pyramids in Egypt and playing in the snow in the US. A 2004 article about homeschooling in the Lawrence Journal-World featured Fluke-Ekren and her children. She told the paper she pulled her kids from public school because she was dissatisfied with how her children were performing in public and private schools. Homeschooling allowed her to teach Arabic to her kids. Prosecutors say Fluke-Ekren wanted to recruit operatives to attack a college campus in the US and discussed the idea of attacking a shopping mall by remotely detonating a car full of explosives in the parking garage. She told one witness that 'she considered any attack that did not kill a large number of individuals to be a waste of resources,' according to an FBI affidavit. The same witness said that when Fluke-Ekren would hear about terrorist attacks taking place in countries outside the US, she would comment that she wished the attack occurred on American soil instead. She is alleged to have led an all-female unit comprised of the wives of male ISIS fighters was trained in the use of AK-47 rifles, grenades and suicide belts. The members of Khatiba Nusaybah were allegedly instructed on physical training, medical training, Vehicle-Borne Improvised Explosive Device driving courses, religious classes and how to pack and prepare a 'go bag' with military supplies. According to eyewitness accounts, some of these classes were taught by Fluke-Ekren. One witness allegedly observed that the leaders of ISIS and the other members of the military battalion were proud to have an American instructor. A detention memo stated that Fluke-Ekren trained children how to use assault rifles, and that at least one witness saw one of Fluke-Ekren's children, approximately 5 or 6 years old, holding a machine gun in the family's home in Syria. In all, the affidavit cites observations from six different witnesses, including some who have been charged with terrorism offenses and some who were held at prison camps for former Islamic state members."
14,Johns Hopkins professor blasts his OWN college and the mainstream media for not publicizing study that found COVID lockdowns only reduced deaths by 0.2% because it doesn't fit their 'narrative',https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10471265/Johns-Hopkins-professor-blasts-college-media-downplaying-study-COVID-lockdowns.html,"A Johns Hopkins professor slammed his university and the mainstream media for downplaying a study conducted by economists at the university that found that COVID-19 lockdowns only reduced virus deaths by 0.2 percent. Dr. Martin Makary warned that 'people may already have their own narrative written' about the effectiveness of lockdowns in an interview with Tucker Carlson Wednesday night. 'Johns Hopkins itself did not even put out a press release about this study, and if you look at the media coverage, it's one of the biggest stories in the world today, and yet certain media outlets have not even covered it,' Makary told the Fox News host. Makary is a professor of surgery at the private university in Baltimore. He was not involved in the study. Economists at the college carried out a meta-analysis and found that restrictions imposed in the spring of 2020 - including stay-at-home orders, compulsory masks and social distancing - only reduced COVID mortality by 0.2 percent. They warned that lockdowns caused 'enormous economic and social costs' and concluded that they were 'ill-founded and should be rejected as a pandemic policy instrument' going forward. Makary said the small number of lives saved by the lockdowns doesn't come close to those lost to lack of health care, such as patients who forwent cancer treatments. The study found that lockdowns imposed in many US cities in the spring of 2020 led to a reduction of COVID deaths by 0.2 percent. 'Now compare that number, which turns out to be about 1,800 individuals, to the number of non-COVID deaths, what we call the ""excess non-COVID mortality"" in the United States. 'It was 124,000 excess deaths in year one. So, over two years, it was about a quarter million people who died. Many many scientists have now begun to peel back this number,' Makary said. He explained that 60,000 to 70,000 of them died from substance abuse, while others died from deferred cancer care, self harm and other side effects of lockdowns. The surgeon also pointed out the number of children who fell behind as schooling moved online. 'There are hundreds of kids in Baltimore alone that the teachers described never logged on to their virtual learning modules, ever,' he said. Makary criticized Johns Hopkins and the mainstream media for not publicizing the findings. 'Pretty quickly we started to get the data from Northern Italy that, not only was it not equally distributed in the population, but the harm was so profoundly skewed towards older people and people with co-morbidities,' he said. 'Even in the early days of New York, we got data that was largely ignored. That 80 percent of the deaths were in people over 65, and half of them, roughly, were in nursing homes. 'And yet we continued to treat this as if everybody was at equal risk, and we continue to do that today. In schools, where children bear the biggest burden of the restrictions in this country. So I think the public is hungry for honesty and basic humility from public health officials.' Republicans say the new report proves that Dr. Anthony Fauci and his claim that pandemic restrictions saved 'millions' are not to be trusted. 'Bad judgment and poor leadership from our nation's health agencies have caused most Americans to live with an unhealthy fear of COVID-19. There is no doubt, we need a new approach to COVID as we must learn to live with it,' Sen. Roger Marshall, R-Kansas, told DailyMail.com upon review of the new Johns Hopkins research. 'That new approach should not include Dr. Fauci – American's don't trust him and he has lost his reputation. We must stop the obsession with COVID, stop living in fear and move forward.' They warned that lockdowns caused 'enormous economic and social costs' and concluded they were 'ill-founded and should be rejected as a pandemic policy instrument' going forward. The review, led by a Johns Hopkins University professor, argued that border closures had virtually zero effect on Covid mortality, reducing deaths by just 0.1 per cent. However, closing nonessential shops was found to be the most effective intervention, leading to a 10.6 per cent drop in virus fatalities. 'I hope we'll learn from this the study,' Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., said on Fox News Wednesday. 'There was no correlation between any of the mandates the government put in place and any change in the incidence of the disease.' He recalled when Fauci said that lockdowns had saved millions of lives. 'The fact that we shut down when we did, and the rest of the world did, has saved hundreds of millions of infections and millions of lives,' Fauci said in June 2020. Paul called for Fauci's removal, which he has done repeatedly. 'It's become so politicized that I don't think Dr. Fauci will ever apologize or admit to the country, but we need to have people like him removed from office because they've been so wrong on so much policy.' Their report, which has not been peer-reviewed, said that this was probably due to shutting pubs and restaurants where alcohol is consumed.School closures were linked to a smaller 4.4 per cent decrease. 'Johns Hopkins University: The 2020 Covid-19 lockdowns had “little to no” effect on mortality. The American people and businesses have paid a huge price due to poor Democrat governance,' Rep. Lance Gooden, R-Texas, wrote on Twitter. The researchers — who deal in the field of economics, rather than medicine or public health — originally identified 18,590 global studies into lockdowns, which they claim had to be whittled down to just 24 to answer their research question. Critics have accused them of 'cherry-picking' studies to suit their narrative and have raised doubts about the biases of its authors, who have been vocal about lockdowns and vaccine mandates on social media. Most scientists believe that, before the arrival of vaccines and antivirals, lockdowns had a significant effect on cutting transmission and therefore reducing the number of hospital admissions and deaths caused by Covid. But there has been a growing consensus that draconian restrictions have led to a rise in non-Covid deaths, thought to be people whose conditions worsened during the pandemic when they could not access healthcare. In the latest report, the researchers admit their review does not answer 'why' lockdowns didn't achieve their ultimate goal in saving lives but they float a number of explanations. The pandemic has battered the economies of the UK and US, with inflation rates rising to their highest level for decades. Lockdowns pushed consumer spending to its lowest levels, while border closures and staff shortages choked supply runs. Meanwhile, furlough schemes and the procurement of PPE and vaccines saw unprecedented public spending. And new mutations could prolong the financial hardship, with economists downgrading their forecasts for the first quarter of 2022 after the emergence of Omicron. UK Inflation soared to a 30-year high in the UK this year, hitting 5.4 per cent — the highest figure recorded since 1992. The Office for National Statistics said the current rate is influenced by the pandemic, which saw retail sales, goods exports and monthly GDP drop by around a fifth at the start of the crisis. Covid also sent UK borrowing to its highest level since records began, with the Government plunging another £299billion into debt in the first year of the pandemic. Experts believe No10 will borrow less in the 12 months to April 2022, but the figure could still exceed £200billion. And ministers are proceeding with a national insurance hike, which will see the average Briton paying an extra £214 per year, in part to deal with the Covid-fuelled NHS backlog. Ministers also wasted £8.7billion of taxpayers' money on unusable personal protective equipment (PPE) which was not up to standard. A total of £12.1billion was spent on PPE in the first year of the pandemic alone. And the UK spent billions ordering 540million doses of eight different Covid vaccines. While the Prime Minister pledged to donate 100million jabs, hundreds of million of jabs are still left over.  US Inflation spiked to 7 per cent in the US in December, marking the seventh month in a row that the figure has soared above 5 per cent. Covid-related supply problems, that continue to impact the price of goods, are partly behind the rise. National debt skyrocketed to $31.3trillion after huge sums were borrowed during the pandemic— four years earlier than expected. And GDP fell at the quickest rate seen in 70 years when lockdown restrictions were implemented in 2020. The US sought $5trillion to combat the pandemic to support the unemployed and small businesses and issue stimulus cheques worth thousands of dollars to Americans. They suggest that lockdowns may have greater unintended consequences than was previously thought. An example given was thatisolating people at home may have led to them passing a higher viral load to their family members, causing more severe illness. Or closing certain retail businesses may lead to a higher concentration of people in 'essential' shops where the risk of transmission is higher. Another possible theory is that people's behaviour rebounded afterlockdowns squashed case rates so low, they perceived the virus as less of a threat. They claimed the best explanation for differing Covid death rates in countries was 'differences in population age and health' and the 'quality of the health sector. But they could not rule out 'less obvious factors, such as culture, communication, and coincidences'. Covid deaths are also skewed by the volume of testing each country carries out, which many scientists have highlighted as the driving factor behind Britain's large toll. To come to their findings, the researchers said they whittled down 18,590 global studies on lockdown and lockdown restrictions to 117. The criteria for the studies to be eligible were they must measure the effect of lockdown on mortality and use an 'empirical approach' - meaning to use real-world data. These were then boiled down to just 34 papers, with the others discarded for various reasons, including being duplicates or papers written by student papers. Reasons for excluding others were vague, however, with nine papers left out because they had 'too few observations' and nine more because they 'only looked at timing'. At least two studies - one in the UK - that found clear drops in Covid deaths by comparing the rate directly before and after a lockdown were left out because the researchers claimed they may have been biased by 'time-dependent factors' such as seasonality. A popular paper which claimed 3million lives in Europe had been saved due to the spring 2020 lockdowns was also excluded - because it relied on modelling. Crucially, the researchers also left out studies which looked at early lockdowns in countries which managedto suppress Covid and record extremely low death rates during the pandemic through incredibly strict lockdowns and border controls — such as China, Australia and New Zealand. Noting this limitation, the authors write: 'One objection to our conclusions may be that we do not look at the role of timing. If timing is very important, differences in timing may empirically overrule any differences in lockdowns.' They add: 'Including these studies will greatly overestimate the effect of lockdowns, and, hence, we chose not to include studies focusing on timing of lockdowns in our review.' For reasons that are not made clear, only 24 of the 34 studies were actually carried through for the final analysis.The fact-checking website Truth Or Fiction criticised the latest paper for selecting papers that suited the authors' own opinions. The report was led by Steve Hanke, a founder of the Johns Hopkins School of Applied Economics. He has been an outspoken critic of economically-damaging restrictions throughout the pandemic, describing jab mandates as 'fascist' and an open supporter of the Great Barrington Declaration - a controversial alternative strategy endorsed by thousands of top scientists at the start of the pandemic. The GBR - signed before vaccines were on the horizon - advocated shielding the most elderly and allowing the virus to spread in younger age groups, to build up natural immunity. The review concluded thatlockdowns'marginal at best' benefits needed to be compared with their 'devastating effects' on the economy and society.  'They have contributed to reducing economic activity, raising unemployment, reducing schooling, causing political unrest, contributing to domestic violence, and undermining liberal democracy,' they wrote. Covid continues to recede in the United States, and after weeks of surging cases nationwide, daily counts are starting to trend in the right direction nationwide. As of Tuesday morning, 41 U.S. states are now recording declining daily Covid infections over the past two weeks. Those that are continuing to see cases grow are generally less dense states where it took longer for theOmicron variant to take hold. Overall, the U.S. is recording a 36 percent decrease in cases over the past seven days, averaging 469,770 per day, down from 736,221 a week ago. It is the first time since January 3 that the daily case average has dropped below a half million, a milestone in the drop in cases being recorded by the country. The east coast states that fueled the record Omicron surge during December and early January - causing cases to peak around 800,000 per day last month - are now fueling the sharp decrease in cases as well. New York and New Jersey far outpaced the rest of the country when Omicron first arrived in the U.S. at the end of last year. Both states are now recording declines of over 70 percent over the past two weeks, though, as the variant quickly ran its course after burning through New York City and nearby areas. Other east coast states in the mid-Atlantic and New England that suffered early surges are seeing cases come down as well. Maryland is currently the leaders in case decline among U.S. states, recording a 75 percent drop over the past two weeks. Case declines are now spreading into the Midwest as well, showing the variant burning out even among states that experienced the secondary Omicron wave. Wisconsin has experienced a 71 percent drop in cases over the past two weeks, with Ohio also recording a sharp drop of 67 percent. Experts predicted a quick decline in cases in early January, as Covid generally runs on two month cycles. Cases also began to show signs of tapering off in major population centers like New York City, Chicago and Los Angeles in the early weeks of the new year. Falling case counts in recent weeks has also loudened calls to lift remaining Covid related mask and vaccine mandates still in place in some parts of America. Dr Scott Gottlieb, former director of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and current board member at Pfizer, said onCNBC's Squawk Box Monday that people would not be willing to continue to abide by these restrictions as cases decline. 'Society isn't going to tolerate these things in perpetuity. The mitigation we've adopted has to be used to deal with epidemic peaks, not be a constant way of life,' he said. 'We are going to have to be willing to withdraw these mitigations.' A precedent has been set as well, with some of the countries that were struck hardest by the Omicron variant already laying out plans for post-pandemic life.

'We are going to have to be willing to withdraw these mitigations.' A precedent has been set as well, with some of the countries that were struck hardest by the Omicron variant already laying out plans for post-pandemic life. Earlier this month, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced the end of all pandemic related restrictions, including the end of mask mandates, some capacity restrictions, and work from home orders. Testing requirements for Britons to return to the nation will be dropped in the coming weeks as well. This comes after a miraculous turnaround for the nation that was struck early by the variant, and was struck so hard some officials feared the nation's hospital system would be overwhelmed. The UK is averaging just under 90,000 Covid cases per day as of Monday morning, a far fall from the peak of over 180,000 cases earlier this month. Denmark was among the hardest hit nations in the world by Omicron in December as well. Cases in the country are still steadily rising, up to 45,000 per day, they are clearly cresting and deaths have remained low for the Nordic country throughout the pandemic. Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen announced last week that Covid was no longer a 'socially critical sickness' and that the country will end all pandemic-related restrictions on February 1. Deaths from the virus are still rising in the U.S., though, as the metric often lags behind cases by a few weeks. America is suffering 2,452 Covid deaths everyday, a 12 percent increase over the past week and the highest average since February 2021 - the tail end of the pandemic's deadliest surge yet. Covid's death rate is lower than thought, official data suggests after nearly 600,000 reinfections were piled into the Government's own tally. Fatality rates from the coronavirus are up to 30 times lower now than during the devastating second wave, thanks to the build-up of natural immunity, a hugely successful vaccination drive and the milder nature of Omicron. But the proportion of infected people who end up dying has fallen by another 10 per cent after last night's update, according to MailOnline's analysis. Just 0.23 per cent of all confirmed cases led to deaths in England before the long-awaited addition of reinfections, UK Health Security Agency statistics suggest. However, the rate for exactly the same time period — which relates to mid-January — has now dropped to 0.21 per cent because of the addition of extra cases. This is still slightly above flu, which has a case-fatality rate of around 0.1 per cent. But some experts claim the two figures are very similar, even if coronavirus is much more transmissible. Professor Paul Hunter, an expert in infectious diseases from the University of East Anglia, said reinfections were 'almost always' milder than primary infections. He added: 'Consequently, we can expect the severity of Covid to decrease further as more and more of the daily infections are reinfections.' MailOnline calculated the case fatality rate (CFR) — used by epidemiologists to check the severity of a disease — by dividing the seven-day average of Covid cases by deaths two weeks later. A lag was built in because of the time taken for someone who catches the virus to die from the disease. Latest data for January 12 — the latest date available to calculate the CFR — showed 91,955 people were testing positive for the first time every day, on average. At the same time, fatalities — defined as deaths within 28 days of a positive test — stood at roughly 213. But in last night's update to include 588,114 reinfections since the pandemic began, the average number of cases for January 12 shot up by 10,000. This pushedthe CFR down slightly from its previous level. Covid death numbers were not only those fatalities directly due to the virus, which likely would have pushed the CFR even lower. Covid reinfections were rare at the start of the pandemic because so few Britons had caught the virus due to lockdowns and stringent self-isolation rules. The UKHSA — which defines reinfections as when someone tests positive for the virus more than 90 days after a previous positive swab — logged its first in June 2020, just four months into the pandemic. Reinfections accounted for less than two per cent of Covid cases — or one in 50 infections — during the Alpha and Delta waves that struck the UK. But since the arrival of Omicron they have been ticking upwards, with the variant known to be better at evading previous immunity. At the end of December reinfections made up about eight per cent of cases, but they are now behind more than 11 per cent. Despite the rise, Professor Hunter said there was no sign that reinfections were changing the course of the current Omicron wave. He added that there was no need to impose further restrictions to tackle them. Experts said last night the addition of the figures could also be an early warning sign of waning immunity, helping officials determine when extra booster shots might be needed. UK officials have already secured enough Covid doses to roll out fourth shots if needed in the coming months — and other countries including Israel have already launched revaccination campaigns. As well as the reinfections, UKHSA bosses also logged an additional 173,328 'formerly unreported' cases. The revision pushed up the UK's official cumulative tally by 4.1 per cent to 14.8million confirmed cases since the pandemic began. But only England and Northern Ireland are currently reporting reinfection figures. Scotland and Wales say they will also start to publish the statistics in the coming days. Britain has recorded 156,000 Covid deaths since March 2020. Other surveillance measures paint a similar picture. The ONS — which counts fatalities by mentions of the virus on death certificates — says the toll stands at around 178,000. But the proportion down to the virus is now pointing downwards, with latest Office for National Statistics figures showing one in five Covid fatalities (402 out of 1,484 deaths) were not due to the virus in the week to January 21. For comparison, the share of deaths not primarily due to the virus stood at around 16 per cent when Omicron first arrived in the UK. With the Alpha wave last January, before vaccines were dished out en masse, the proportion was about 10 per cent."
15,'We must stop living in fear and move forward': GOP Senator leads Republican fury at Fauci's 'lies' and constant COVID lockdowns after major study showed they only reduced mortality by 0.2% and wreaked economic havoc,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10470293/GOP-Senator-leads-Republican-fury-study-showed-lockdowns-reduced-mortality-0-2.html,"Republicans are saying a controversial new report finding that coronavirus lockdowns had 'little to no effects' on pandemic death tolls proves that Dr. Anthony Fauci and his claim that pandemic restrictions saved 'millions' are not to be trusted. 'Bad judgment and poor leadership from our nation's health agencies have caused most Americans to live with an unhealthy fear of COVID-19. There is no doubt, we need a new approach to COVID as we must learn to live with it,' Sen. Roger Marshall, R-Kansas, told DailyMail.com upon review of the new Johns Hopkins research. 'That new approach should not include Dr. Fauci – American's don't trust him and he has lost his reputation. We must stop the obsession with COVID, stop living in fear and move forward.' Economists who carried out a meta-analysis found draconian restrictions imposed in spring 2020 — including stay-at-home orders, compulsory masks and social distancing — only reduced Covid mortality by 0.2 per cent. They warned that lockdowns caused 'enormous economic and social costs' and concluded they were 'ill-founded and should be rejected as a pandemic policy instrument' going forward. The review, led by a Johns Hopkins University professor, argued that border closures had virtually zero effect on Covid mortality, reducing deaths by just 0.1 per cent. However, closing nonessential shops was found to be the most effective intervention, leading to a 10.6 per cent drop in virus fatalities. 'I hope we'll learn from this the study,' Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., said on Fox News Wednesday. 'There was no correlation between any of the mandates the government put in place and any change in the incidence of the disease.' He recalled when Fauci said that lockdowns had saved millions of lives. 'The fact that we shut down when we did, and the rest of the world did, has saved hundreds of millions of infections and millions of lives,' Fauci said in June 2020. Paul called for Fauci's removal, which he has done repeatedly. 'It's become so politicized that I don't think Dr. Fauci will ever apologize or admit to the country, but we need to have people like him removed from office because they've been so wrong on so much policy.' Their report, which has not been peer-reviewed, said that this was probably due to shutting pubs and restaurants where alcohol is consumed.School closures were linked to a smaller 4.4 per cent decrease.

Meanwhile, furlough schemes and the procurement of PPE and vaccines saw unprecedented public spending. And new mutations could prolong the financial hardship, with economists downgrading their forecasts for the first quarter of 2022 after the emergence of Omicron. UK Inflation soared to a 30-year high in the UK this year, hitting 5.4 per cent — the highest figure recorded since 1992. The Office for National Statistics said the current rate is influenced by the pandemic, which saw retail sales, goods exports and monthly GDP drop by around a fifth at the start of the crisis. Covid also sent UK borrowing to its highest level since records began, with the Government plunging another £299billion into debt in the first year of the pandemic. Experts believe No10 will borrow less in the 12 months to April 2022, but the figure could still exceed £200billion.

While the Prime Minister pledged to donate 100million jabs, hundreds of million of jabs are still left over.  US Inflation spiked to 7 per cent in the US in December, marking the seventh month in a row that the figure has soared above 5 per cent. Covid-related supply problems, that continue to impact the price of goods, are partly behind the rise. National debt skyrocketed to $31.3trillion after huge sums were borrowed during the pandemic— four years earlier than expected. And GDP fell at the quickest rate seen in 70 years when lockdown restrictions were implemented in 2020.

Covid continues to recede in the United States, and after weeks of surging cases nationwide, daily counts are starting to trend in the right direction nationwide. As of Tuesday morning, 41 U.S. states are now recording declining daily Covid infections over the past two weeks. Those that are continuing to see cases grow are generally less dense states where it took longer for theOmicron variant to take hold. Overall, the U.S. is recording a 36 percent decrease in cases over the past seven days, averaging 469,770 per day, down from 736,221 a week ago.

Other east coast states in the mid-Atlantic and New England that suffered early surges are seeing cases come down as well. Maryland is currently the leaders in case decline among U.S. states, recording a 75 percent drop over the past two weeks. Case declines are now spreading into the Midwest as well, showing the variant burning out even among states that experienced the secondary Omicron wave. Wisconsin has experienced a 71 percent drop in cases over the past two weeks, with Ohio also recording a sharp drop of 67 percent.

Earlier this month, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced the end of all pandemic related restrictions, including the end of mask mandates, some capacity restrictions, and work from home orders. Testing requirements for Britons to return to the nation will be dropped in the coming weeks as well. This comes after a miraculous turnaround for the nation that was struck early by the variant, and was struck so hard some officials feared the nation's hospital system would be overwhelmed. The UK is averaging just under 90,000 Covid cases per day as of Monday morning, a far fall from the peak of over 180,000 cases earlier this month. Denmark was among the hardest hit nations in the world by Omicron in December as well. Cases in the country are still steadily rising, up to 45,000 per day, they are clearly cresting and deaths have remained low for the Nordic country throughout the pandemic. Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen announced last week that Covid was no longer a 'socially critical sickness' and that the country will end all pandemic-related restrictions on February 1. Deaths from the virus are still rising in the U.S., though, as the metric often lags behind cases by a few weeks. America is suffering 2,452 Covid deaths everyday, a 12 percent increase over the past week and the highest average since February 2021 - the tail end of the pandemic's deadliest surge yet. Covid's death rate is lower than thought, official data suggests after nearly 600,000 reinfections were piled into the Government's own tally. Fatality rates from the coronavirus are up to 30 times lower now than during the devastating second wave, thanks to the build-up of natural immunity, a hugely successful vaccination drive and the milder nature of Omicron. But the proportion of infected people who end up dying has fallen by another 10 per cent after last night's update, according to MailOnline's analysis. Just 0.23 per cent of all confirmed cases led to deaths in England before the long-awaited addition of reinfections, UK Health Security Agency statistics suggest. However, the rate for exactly the same time period — which relates to mid-January — has now dropped to 0.21 per cent because of the addition of extra cases. This is still slightly above flu, which has a case-fatality rate of around 0.1 per cent. But some experts claim the two figures are very similar, even if coronavirus is much more transmissible. Professor Paul Hunter, an expert in infectious diseases from the University of East Anglia, said reinfections were 'almost always' milder than primary infections. He added: 'Consequently, we can expect the severity of Covid to decrease further as more and more of the daily infections are reinfections.' MailOnline calculated the case fatality rate (CFR) — used by epidemiologists to check the severity of a disease — by dividing the seven-day average of Covid cases by deaths two weeks later. A lag was built in because of the time taken for someone who catches the virus to die from the disease. Latest data for January 12 — the latest date available to calculate the CFR — showed 91,955 people were testing positive for the first time every day, on average. At the same time, fatalities — defined as deaths within 28 days of a positive test — stood at roughly 213. But in last night's update to include 588,114 reinfections since the pandemic began, the average number of cases for January 12 shot up by 10,000. This pushedthe CFR down slightly from its previous level. Covid death numbers were not only those fatalities directly due to the virus, which likely would have pushed the CFR even lower. Covid reinfections were rare at the start of the pandemic because so few Britons had caught the virus due to lockdowns and stringent self-isolation rules. The UKHSA — which defines reinfections as when someone tests positive for the virus more than 90 days after a previous positive swab — logged its first in June 2020, just four months into the pandemic. Reinfections accounted for less than two per cent of Covid cases — or one in 50 infections — during the Alpha and Delta waves that struck the UK. But since the arrival of Omicron they have been ticking upwards, with the variant known to be better at evading previous immunity. At the end of December reinfections made up about eight per cent of cases, but they are now behind more than 11 per cent. Despite the rise, Professor Hunter said there was no sign that reinfections were changing the course of the current Omicron wave. He added that there was no need to impose further restrictions to tackle them. Experts said last night the addition of the figures could also be an early warning sign of waning immunity, helping officials determine when extra booster shots might be needed. UK officials have already secured enough Covid doses to roll out fourth shots if needed in the coming months — and other countries including Israel have already launched revaccination campaigns. As well as the reinfections, UKHSA bosses also logged an additional 173,328 'formerly unreported' cases. The revision pushed up the UK's official cumulative tally by 4.1 per cent to 14.8million confirmed cases since the pandemic began. But only England and Northern Ireland are currently reporting reinfection figures. Scotland and Wales say they will also start to publish the statistics in the coming days. Britain has recorded 156,000 Covid deaths since March 2020. Other surveillance measures paint a similar picture. The ONS — which counts fatalities by mentions of the virus on death certificates — says the toll stands at around 178,000. But the proportion down to the virus is now pointing downwards, with latest Office for National Statistics figures showing one in five Covid fatalities (402 out of 1,484 deaths) were not due to the virus in the week to January 21. For comparison, the share of deaths not primarily due to the virus stood at around 16 per cent when Omicron first arrived in the UK. With the Alpha wave last January, before vaccines were dished out en masse, the proportion was about 10 per cent."
16,"US Army will start discharging vaccine refuseniks immediately: 3,300 soldiers - about 3% - now face the ax",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10469593/Army-immediately-start-discharging-vaccine-refusers.html,"The US Army said Wednesday it will immediately begin discharging soldiers who have refused to get the mandatory COVID-19 vaccine, putting more than 3,300 service members - or about 3 percent of the largest military branch - at risk of being thrown out. The Army's announcement makes it the final military service to lay out its discharge policy for vaccine refusers. The branch's deadline for vaccinations was December 15. The Marine Corps, Air Force and Navy have already discharged active-duty troops or entry-level personnel at boot camps for refusing the shots. So far, the Army hasn't discharged any. According to data released by the Army last week, 3,350 soldiers have refused to get the vaccine. Another 3,600 have requested medical or religious exemptions. Roughly 97 percent of all Army soldiers have gotten at least one shot. Last week, the Navy announced it had fired 45 sailors for refusing the vaccine.The Marine Corps has discharged 334, the US Naval Institutereported last month. The Air Force said last month that it had fired 27 service members. In August, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin publicly announced a vaccine mandate for all service members, but allowed each service to set its own deadline. The services, urgently trying to keep the coronavirus pandemic in check by getting troops vaccinated, remain besieged with exemption requests they are unlikely to approve. US Army Deadline: Dec. 15 Percent vaccinated: 97% Members dismissed:3,300 at risk of being fired US Navy Deadline: Nov. 28 Percent vaccinated: 97% Members dismissed: 45 as of last week US Air Force Deadline: Nov. 2 Percent vaccinated: 97.5% Members dismissed: 64, including members in basic training US Coast Guard Deadline: Nov. 22 Percent vaccinated: 95.3%, including partially vaccinated Members dismissed: Unknown Marine Corps Deadline: Nov. 28 Percent vaccinated: 96%, including partially vaccinated Members dismissed: 334 Sources: Individual branches, Washington Post, US Naval Institute In an update issued January 26, the Navy said it had let go of 23 Active Component sailors and 22 entry-level sailors, who were separated during initial training in their first 180 days of service. The branch has issued 10 permanent medical exemptions, 259 temporary medical exemptions and 59 administrative exemptions to active-duty service members. No religious accommodation requests have been approved. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that everyone aged 5 and up gets a COVID-19 vaccine 'as soon as possible.' In December, the Air Force said it had dismissed 27 service members for not getting the vaccine, CNNreported, while 37 people in basic training had already been removed, making for a total of 64 separations. The branch had the earliest vaccine mandate deadline, which was set for November 2. About 97.5 percent of active duty Air Force members are now fully vaccinated, according to the branch's latest numbers. In the Marine Corps, five percent of service members remained unvaccinated as of January 20, according to the US Naval Institute,a non-profit, private military association. The total was four percent when counting partial vaccination. The Marines has adjudicated 3,293 requests out of 3,376 religious exemption requests, but only only two had been approved at the time. The service approved 635 medical or administrative exemptions and fired 334 Marines for refusing to get the shot. The Coast Guard had a deadline of November 22. By the end of the year,94.4 percent of active-duty members were fully vaccinated, the US Naval Institute reported on January 3. About 95.3 percent had received one shot. The branch hadn't fired anyone at that point. The Army has said that more than 3,000 soldiers have been issued official written reprimands, which suggests they are already identified in the disciplinary process, and some of them could be among the first to be discharged. Meanwhile, more than 3,600 have asked for religious or medical exemptions, according to a tally from January 26. Of those, only six permanent medical exemptions have been approved, while more than 5,800 temporary exemptions were granted. The Pentagon has ordered all service members - active-duty, National Guard and Reserves - to get the vaccine, saying it is critical to maintaining the health and readiness of the force. COVID-19 cases continue to surge around the country as a result of the omicron variant. Army Secretary Christine Wormuth issued the directive Wednesday ordering commanders to begin involuntary separation proceedings against those who have refused the shots and do not have a pending or approved exemption. 'Army readiness depends on soldiers who are prepared to train, deploy, fight and win our nation's wars,' she said. 'Unvaccinated soldiers present risk to the force and jeopardize readiness. We will begin involuntary separation proceedings for Soldiers who refuse the vaccine order and are not pending a final decision on an exemption.' The order includes active-duty soldiers, reserves serving on active duty, and cadets at the Military Academy at West Point, its preparatory school and ROTC. The detailed order said soldiers will be discharged for misconduct, and noted that those who are eligible to retire may do so before July 1. Overall, more than 650 Marines, airmen and sailors have been thrown out of the military or dismissed from entry-level training at boot camps, according to data released in the past two weeks by the services. The military services have been going through a methodical process to deal with those who refuse the vaccine as well as those who request medical, administrative or religious exemptions. The reviews require counseling with medical personnel and chaplains as well as senior commanders."
17,US archeologists criticize Australian researchers for claiming they've found British explorer Captain Cook's ship off Rhode Island - but say site is 'consistent with what might be expected of the Endeavour' ,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10471237/US-archeologists-criticize-Australian-researchers-said-theyve-wreck-Endeavour.html,"Americanarchaeologists have criticized Australian researchers who saidthey believe they've found the wreck ofBritish explorer Captain Cook's ship off Rhode Island, calling the announcement 'premature' andbreach of contract in their joint research. On Thursday, director and CEO of the Australian National Maritime Museum, Kevin Sumptionconfirmed that the shipwreck of Cook's vessel 'the Endeavour' had been identified in Newport Harbor, Rhode Island, wheremaritime archaeologists had been investigating several 18th century shipwrecks since 1999. Cook famously sailed the ship around the South Pacific before he landed on the east coast of Australia in 1770 - with the wreckage is now believed to have been laying in US waters for almost 250 years. The last sighting of the HMS Endeavour was around 1778 during the Revolutionary War when it is believed the ship was sold, renamed the Lord Sandwich, and then used to transport British troops before it was scuttled in Newport Harbor. But Dr. Kathy Abbass, executive director of Rhode Island Marine Archaeology said Sumption got ahead of himself with the announcement, and any official findings will be'driven by proper scientific process and not Australian emotions or politics'. Dr. Abbass added that Rhode Island Marine Archaeology is the charge of the investigation and the Australian National Maritime Museum does not have the authority to confirm any such findings without their approval. 'The Australian National Maritime Museum announcement today is a breach of the contract... for the conduct of this research and how its results are to be shared with the public,' Dr Abbass said. 'What we see on the shipwreck site under study is consistent with what might be expected of the Endeavour, but there has been no indisputable data found to prove the site is that iconic vessel, and there are many unanswered questions that could overturn such an identification. 'RIMAP is now and always has been the lead organization for the study in Newport harbor.' The Australian National Maritime Museum issued an immediate and defiant response, saying Ms Abbass 'can have her opinion and we've got ours'. 'We don't believe we are in breach of contract,' a spokesperson said. 'We are about to embark on a due process of putting the paper out to the archaeological community and so further insights will be made as happens with all archaeological projects. 'She can have her opinion and we've got ours.' The HMS Endeavour is one of the most famous ships in naval history and was used for Captain Cook's discovery of the East Coast of Australia in 1770. 'It's arguably one of the most important vessels in Australia's maritime history,' Mr Sumption told reporters. 'I am satisfied that this is the final resting place of one of the most important and contentious vessels in Australia's maritime history,' The last pieces of the puzzle had to be confirmed before I felt able to make this call. 'Based on archival and archaeological evidence, I'm convinced it's the Endeavour.' 'It's an important historical moment, as this vessel's role in exploration, astronomy and science applies not just to Australia, but also Aotearoa New Zealand, the United Kingdom and the United States.' Several details on the wreck convinced archaeologists they had found Endeavour after matching structural details and the shape of the remains to those on 18th century plans of Endeavour. Just 15 per cent of the vessel remains with researchers now focused on what can be done to protect and preserve it. 'We will continue to investigate and look closely with maritime experts at Rhode Island about the future of this site and what should happen to this site but certainly protection is what we're working towards right now,' Sumption said. Researchers are finalizing their report on the site, which will be peer-reviewed and published. The HMS Endeavour was first launched in 1764 as the Earl of Pembroke, and then renamed His Majesty's Bark the Endeavour after it was purchased four years later by the British Royal Navy. The vessel was sent out to explore the Pacific Ocean in August 1768 both to observe the 1769 transit of Venus across the sun, and search for the continent which was then called Terra Australis Incognita, or unknown Southern land. The previous transit of Venus in 1639 had provided a vast amount of the information astronomers and scientists had about the size of the solar system and universe. The ship departed from Plymouth with 94 people on board, including Captain James Cook. After travelling down the coast of Africa before cutting across the Atlantic, it arrived in Rio de Janeiro in November of that year. The boat then set out to round Cape Horn, which it managed to do on its third attempt in January after wind, stormy weather and difficult conditions foiled Cook's first two attempts. In April the ship reached Tahiti, where it stayed for the next four months and where astronomer Charles Green was able to study the transit of Venus in June. After months exploring the Pacific for islands, the Endeavour reached the coast of New Zealand in October, becoming the first European vessel to land on the island in over 100 years. Dutch explorer Abel Tasman had previously reached the islands of New Zealand and Tasmania during his 1642 journey while with the Dutch East India Company. Cook spent six months exploring and mapping the coast of New Zealand and claimed the land for Great Britain before sailing west. In April of 1770 individuals on the ship first spotted Australia, and on April 29 the HMS Endeavour became the first European vessel to make landfall on the east coast of the island. Cook spent four months charting the coast and at one point ran into trouble when the ship struck part of the Great Barrier Reef. The ship was 24 miles off the coast at the time with not enough life boats, but managed to clear the water from the hull of the ship and make its way safely back to shore. The ship continued to explore the east cost of Australia, and in November was taken out of the water to have major repairs done before setting sail back to Great Britain. It set sail the day after Christmas, and in March rounded the Cape of Good Hope before docking in Cape Town. On July 12 it made its way into port in Dover, almost three years after it first left from Plymouth. Cook was later promoted to Commander and explored the Pacific twice more on the HMS Resolution. He was killed in 1779 during a fight with Hawaiians on the island. The Endeavor soon become a naval transport ship, and was sold to a shipping magnate just before the start of the Revolutionary War. That individual then tried to sell the ship back to the British when the demand for ships increased during the war but they would not accept the vessel given its age and what it had been through over the years. The seller then made the decision to rename the boat Lord Sandwich and try to sell it again, which worked after the boat underwent serious repairs. It was sent to Rhode Island as a prison ship when the British attempted to recapture the port city of Newport in 1778, and there it was blown up in hopes of creating a blockade in the harbor during the Battle of Rhode Island. *The structural details and shape of the remains closely match historic plans of Endeavour. *The construction of the keel along the bottom of the ship and the joinery used in its bow at the front are identical to those shown on 18th-century plans of the Endeavour. The placement of the vessel's fore and main mast are also identical to the plans. *Historical evidence indicates the ship was sunk in the United States just north of Goat Island in Newport Harbour, along with four other British ships. *The ship was the largest of the five scuttled ships in that area. *The length of the surviving hull is almost exactly the same as that recorded for Endeavour.

18,Spotify reports an 18 percent surge in subscribers and 40 percent spike in advertising revenue in final quarter of 2021 - before musicians began pulling songs over Joe Rogan controversy,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10470619/Spotify-reports-surge-subscribers-despite-Joe-Rogan-controversy.html,"Spotify finished 2021 on a high note after reporting a surge in subscribers and advertisers - but the streaming giant could see some headwinds as artists continue to call for the removal of their recordings from the streaming service due over Joe Rogan's COVID controversy. In its recently completed quarter, which ended December 31, Spotifyreported 406 million monthly active users, up 18 percent from a year earlier, Wall Street Journal reported. Paying subscribersto the Swedish audio streaming giant also rose 16 percentto 180 million, topping the company's expectations. Average revenue per user for the subscription business in the recently completed quarter climbed 3 percent to $4.97, while revenue from subscriptions climbed 22 percent to $2.6 billion. Advertising revenue shot up 40 percent to $445.5 million, making up about 15 percent of total revenue during this quarter,WSJ reported. The surge in subscribers and advertisers was announced a week after singer Neil Young demanded that his music be removed from Spotify, citing the streaming service's distribution partnership with Joe Rogan and accusing Rogan's podcast The Joe Rogan Experience of spreading false information regarding COVID-19 and vaccines. Spotify Chief Executive Daniel Ek called it a very complicated issue and said Rogan, like other creators on the company’s platform, has to abide by its content policies. 'There’s no doubt that the last several weeks have presented a number of learning opportunities,' Ek said during Spotify’s earnings call Wednesday. 'We believe we have a critical role to play in supporting creator expression while balancing it with the safety of our users.' The good quarterly numbers haven't offset Spotify stock price, which is down 44% over the past year to $191.92. It fell another 11% in after-hours trading after the company said it wouldn't provide annual guidance. Spotify financial chief Paul Vogel said during the earning's call that company didn't anticipate any material change this year in its user-growth trajectory, according to the Journal. Young posted a since-deleted open letter to his official website that read in part, 'Please immediately inform Spotify that I am actively canceling all my music availability on Spotify as soon as possible. I am doing this because Spotify is spreading false information about vaccines -- potentially causing death to those who believe the disinformation being spread by them. 'Please act on this immediately today and keep me informed of the time schedule,' the statement continues. 'I want you to let Spotify know immediately today that I want all of my music off their platform. They can have Rogan or Young. Not both.' On Tuesday,David Crosby and Stephen Stills joined Neil Young and Graham Nash in asking their labels to remove their collective recordings from Spotify. According to the announcement, the musicians have decided to remove their records from the streaming platform including the recordings of Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young; Crosby, Stills & Nash and Crosby-Nash, as well as Crosby's and Stills' solo projects. Nash has already begun the process to take down his solo recordings. In a unified statement, the band members commented, 'We support Neil and we agree with him that there is dangerous disinformation being aired on Spotify's Joe Rogan podcast. While we always value alternate points of view, knowingly spreading disinformation during this global pandemic has deadly consequences. Until real action is taken to show that a concern for humanity must be balanced with commerce, we don't want our music - or the music we made together - to be on the same platform.' Following a similar request by Joni Mitchell, the move reunites the five artists, who have been friends and collaborators since the 1960s, in a stance that they certainly could not have imagined 50 years ago. Public health officials have also urged Spotify to take action against Rogan, accusing the massively popular Joe Rogan Experience podcast of possessing a 'concerning history of broadcasting misinformation, particularly regarding the COVID-19 pandemic.' On Spotify's Wednesday's earnings call, CEO Daniel Ek called the issue complicated and said Rogan, like all creators on the platform, has to abide by its content policies. He also said it was too soon to tell if the controversy has had impact on subscribers. 'There's no doubt that the last several weeks have presented a number of learning opportunities,' Ek said on the call. 'We believe we have a critical role to play in supporting creator expression while balancing it with the safety of our users.' At 54, Rogan, the former taekwondo champion has millions of fans, who appreciate his outspokenness, his iconoclastic ideas, and the variety of his guests. But he also has many detractors forspreading disinformation about the coronavirus and other topics on the air. For his accusers, he is particularly dangerous because his show The Joe Rogan Experience, which has been broadcast exclusively on Spotify since 2020 under a deal worth an estimated $100 million, attracts a staggering 11 million listeners per episode on average. Often with a glass of whiskey in hand, he chats casually for two to three hours with a guest on topics as varied as flying saucers, psychedelic drugs, red meat and fitness, slipping in an expletive here and there. In 12 years, he has hosted nearly 1,000 guests, 88 percent of them male, according to the fan site JRELibrary. They include Tesla boss Elon Musk, who smoked a joint on his set, whistleblower Edward Snowden and film director Oliver Stone. But Rogan has also given voice to climate skeptics, conspiracy theorist Alex Jones and, since the start of the pandemic, figures in the anti-vaccine movement, earning him the label of 'a veritable megaphone of right-wing lies' by progressive website Media Matters for America. As for his guests, 'I'm interested in having interesting conversations with people that have differing opinions. I'm not interested in only talking to people that have one perspective,' he said in a video posted on Instagram after Young's criticism that seemingly conflated misinformation with opinions. 'I'm not trying to promote misinformation,' he continued. 'I will do my best to try to balance out these more controversial viewpoints with other people's perspectives.' He said he agreed with Spotify's announcement in response to Young and Mitchell that Covid podcasts would include links to factual and scientifically sourced information. In a perhaps telling comment for someone who was already famous before launching his podcast, he admitted he had not been ready for the 'strange' responsibility of having 'this many viewers and listeners.' 'It's nothing that I prepared for, and it's nothing that I ever anticipated.' David Crosby and Stephen Stills have joined Neil Young and Graham Nash in asking their labels to remove their collective recordings from Spotify. According to the announcement, in support of stopping harmful misinformation about Covid-19 on Joe Rogan's Spotify-hosted podcast, the musicians have decided to remove their songs from the streaming platform, including the recordings of Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young; Crosby, Stills & Nash and Crosby-Nash, as well as Crosby's and Stills' solo projects.

Following a similar request by Joni Mitchell, the move reunites the five artists, who have been friends and collaborators since the 1960s, in a stance that they certainly could not have imagined 50 years ago. While only longtime Young and Bruce Springsteen guitarist Nils Lofgren has joined their stance, many musicians have said that they would like to remove their music from the streaming giant, the world's largest paid music-subscription service, but either can't legally do so, since their music is actually owned by record labels, or cannot afford to. Lofgren - who has played with Springsteen, Young, and others - wrote in Young's newsletter that he was joining his bandmate in 'standing with hundreds of health care professionals, scientists, doctors and nurses' in criticizing Spotify over its role in 'promoting lies and misinformation' regarding Covid.

Some public health officials have also urged Spotify to take action against Rogan, accusing the massively popular Joe Rogan Experience podcast of possessing a 'concerning history of broadcasting misinformation, particularly regarding the COVID-19 pandemic.' Spotify co-founder and CEO Daniel Ek issued a statement on Sunday saying the company was not in the business of censorship but would post Covid information and warnings before relevant podcasts, but the controversy has continued. At 54, Rogan, a former taekwondo champion, has millions of fans who appreciate his outspokenness, his iconoclastic ideas and the variety of his guests. But he also has many detractors including, Young and Mitchell. He has spread disinformation about the coronavirus and other topics on the air. Both musicians said the false claims, and Spotify's failure to do anything about them, was the reason for their decision. R&B singer India Arie followed suit, citing what she said were Rogan's 'problematic' comments on race. For his accusers, he is particularly dangerous because his show, which has been broadcast exclusively on Spotify since 2020 under a deal worth an estimated $100 million, attracts a staggering 11 million listeners per episode on average. Often with a glass of whiskey in hand, he chats casually for two to three hours with a guest on topics as varied as flying saucers, psychedelic drugs, red meat and fitness, slipping in an expletive here and there. Rogan, with a tongue as sharp as his tattooed arms, was already famous when he began the program in 2009. A comedian and martial arts commentator known for tight T-shirts and what critics have branded his 'toxic masculinity,' he appeared on 1990s TV sitcoms including NBC's NewsRadio. Later, he hosted the popular reality show Fear Factor. When he launched the podcast, his ratings quickly took off. People from all walks of life asked to come on. In 12 years, he has hosted nearly 1,000 guests, 88 percent of them male, according to the fan site JRELibrary. They include Tesla boss Elon Musk, who smoked a joint on his set, whistleblower Edward Snowden and film director Oliver Stone. But Rogan has also given voice to climate skeptics, conspiracy theorist Alex Jones and, since the start of the pandemic, figures in the anti-vaccine movement, earning him the label of 'a veritable megaphone of right-wing lies' by progressive website Media Matters for America. Posing as a critic of political correctness, he has attacked the left for demonizing conservatives and flirted with unfounded theories held dear by former president Donald Trump's supporters -- notably about the presence of undercover FBI agents among the US Capitol attackers on January 6 2021. Like the former Republican president, he hates 'losers.' 'I grew up around a lot of losers and one of them was my dad,' a former police officer who was violent and who left his family, Rogan said in an interview in 2016. 'There was a lot of desire to not be like that guy and not be like all of these people around me who had no hope and no future.' Yet he defends himself against accusations of being an ideologue or of voting exclusively on the right. An atheist who supports gay marriage, the decriminalization of soft drugs, and the preservation of gun rights, he calls himself a libertarian and said he even considered supporting self-described socialist Senator Bernie Sanders in the last Democratic primary. As for his guests, 'I'm interested in having interesting conversations with people that have differing opinions. I'm not interested in only talking to people that have one perspective,' he said in a video posted on Instagram after Young's criticism that seemingly conflated misinformation with opinions.

Advertising revenue shot up 40 percent to $445.5 million, making up about 15 percent of total revenue during this quarter,WSJ reported. The surge in subscribers and advertisers was announced a week after singer Neil Young demanded that his music be removed from Spotify, citing the streaming service's distribution partnership with Joe Rogan and accusing Rogan's podcast The Joe Rogan Experience of spreading false information regarding COVID-19 and vaccines. Young started this movement last week by demanding that his music be removed from Spotify, citing the streaming service's distribution partnership with Rogan and accusing Rogan's podcast, The Joe Rogan Experience, of spreading false information regarding COVID-19 and vaccines. The musician posted a since-deleted open letter to his official website that read in part: 'Please immediately inform Spotify that I am actively canceling all my music availability on Spotify as soon as possible. I am doing this because Spotify is spreading false information about vaccines - potentially causing death to those who believe the disinformation being spread by them. 'Please act on this immediately today and keep me informed of the time schedule,' the statement continues. 'I want you to let Spotify know immediately today that I want all of my music off their platform. They can have Rogan or Young. Not both.' Some public health officials have also urged Spotify to take action against Rogan, accusing the massively popular Joe Rogan Experience podcast of possessing a 'concerning history of broadcasting misinformation, particularly regarding the COVID-19 pandemic.' Spotify co-founder and CEO Daniel Ek issued a statement on Sunday saying the company was not in the business of censorship but would post Covid information and warnings before relevant podcasts, but the controversy has continued. At 54, Rogan, a former taekwondo champion, has millions of fans who appreciate his outspokenness, his iconoclastic ideas and the variety of his guests. But he also has many detractors including, Young and Mitchell. He has spread disinformation about the coronavirus and other topics on the air. Both musicians said the false claims, and Spotify's failure to do anything about them, was the reason for their decision. R&B singer India Arie followed suit, citing what she said were Rogan's 'problematic' comments on race. For his accusers, he is particularly dangerous because his show, which has been broadcast exclusively on Spotify since 2020 under a deal worth an estimated $100 million, attracts a staggering 11 million listeners per episode on average. Often with a glass of whiskey in hand, he chats casually for two to three hours with a guest on topics as varied as flying saucers, psychedelic drugs, red meat and fitness, slipping in an expletive here and there. Rogan, with a tongue as sharp as his tattooed arms, was already famous when he began the program in 2009. A comedian and martial arts commentator known for tight T-shirts and what critics have branded his 'toxic masculinity,' he appeared on 1990s TV sitcoms including NBC's NewsRadio. Later, he hosted the popular reality show Fear Factor. When he launched the podcast, his ratings quickly took off. People from all walks of life asked to come on. In 12 years, he has hosted nearly 1,000 guests, 88 percent of them male, according to the fan site JRELibrary. They include Tesla boss Elon Musk, who smoked a joint on his set, whistleblower Edward Snowden and film director Oliver Stone. But Rogan has also given voice to climate skeptics, conspiracy theorist Alex Jones and, since the start of the pandemic, figures in the anti-vaccine movement, earning him the label of 'a veritable megaphone of right-wing lies' by progressive website Media Matters for America. Posing as a critic of political correctness, he has attacked the left for demonizing conservatives and flirted with unfounded theories held dear by former president Donald Trump's supporters -- notably about the presence of undercover FBI agents among the US Capitol attackers on January 6 2021. Like the former Republican president, he hates 'losers.' 'I grew up around a lot of losers and one of them was my dad,' a former police officer who was violent and who left his family, Rogan said in an interview in 2016. 'There was a lot of desire to not be like that guy and not be like all of these people around me who had no hope and no future.' Yet he defends himself against accusations of being an ideologue or of voting exclusively on the right. An atheist who supports gay marriage, the decriminalization of soft drugs, and the preservation of gun rights, he calls himself a libertarian and said he even considered supporting self-described socialist Senator Bernie Sanders in the last Democratic primary. As for his guests, 'I'm interested in having interesting conversations with people that have differing opinions. I'm not interested in only talking to people that have one perspective,' he said in a video posted on Instagram after Young's criticism that seemingly conflated misinformation with opinions. 'I'm not trying to promote misinformation,' he continued. 'I will do my best to try to balance out these more controversial viewpoints with other people's perspectives.' He said he agreed with Spotify's announcement in response to Young and Mitchell that Covid podcasts would include links to factual and scientifically sourced information. In a perhaps telling comment for someone who was already famous before launching his podcast, he admitted he had not been ready for the 'strange' responsibility of having 'this many viewers and listeners.' 'It's nothing that I prepared for, and it's nothing that I ever anticipated.' Joe Rogan has decried the American government and the CDC's approach to the pandemic since late 2020, speaking out against vaccine mandates, vaccine passes, and cautioning healthy young people about the possible side effects of the vaccine. He has also been vocal about the government's reluctance to discuss any other potential treatments of Covid-19 besides the vaccine, and has pointed to several doctors' use of treatments such as monoclonal antibodies and ivermectin to help combat the virus. Roganhas repeatedly stated that he is not an anti-vaxxer, but is critical of the way in which the pandemic has been handled and is suspicious of why public health bodies have pushed the jab before encouraging people to improve their baseline health. Despite criticism from many media outlets and Biden's chief medical adviser Dr Anthony Fauci, the comedian's views have garnered considerable support and in many cases have held up to further inspection. These are some of the key sentiments Rogan has expressed on the pandemic amid the long-running debate over the comedian and his Spotify-hosted podcast The Joe Rogan Experience (JRE): Rogan says big tech is censoring alternative views on vaccines and the pandemic - December 31, 2021: JRE #1757 with Dr Robert Malone Rogan accused big tech of censoring reputable individuals who presented viewpoints alternative to the official narrative, using Malone's Twitter ban as an example. 'They removed you for not going along with whatever the tech narrative is because tech clearly has a censorship agenda when it comes to Covid in terms of treatment, in terms of whether or not you are promoting what they would call 'vaccine hesitancy' - they can ban you for that' Rogan said.   Rogan accused the government of deliberately holding back or discouraging the use of alternative treatments for Covid, such as monoclonal antibodies, and selectively preventing some people from accessing the treatments. 'There's an unlimited supply or a very large supply, more than adequate for the entire population, of monoclonal antibodies. So what is stopping the distribution of them? Because not only have they made it difficult to get in Texas, they actually put these parameters on who gets it and who doesn't.' Rogan also hit out at the FDA and CDC's refusal to include Ivermectin as a Covid treatment, citing the anti-parasitic drug's widespread safe usage around the world and pointing out that his own doctor prescribed Ivermectin with positive results. Rogan says vaccine mandates are anti-American in Instagram clip showing images of the Holocaust -September 27, 2021 At the end of September, Rogan posted a video to his 13 million Instagram followers in which images and videos of the Holocaust were played over clips from his podcast criticizing the US' handling of the pandemic. 'As soon as you give politicians power, any kind of power that didn't exist previously, if they can figure out a way to force you into carrying something that lets you enter businesses or lets you do this or lets businesses open, historically, they are not gonna give that power up,' Rogan warns. 'It is the literal structure that allows this country to be so f***ing amazing. Anything that comes along that can inhibit your freedom is, by definition, anti-American.' Rogan does not mention the Holocaust or Nazis directly in the clip, but the images are overlaid with a clear warning for people to protect their freedoms.  Rogan declares alternative treatments to the vaccine, including Ivermectin, are effective in Instagram video and calls out CNN for false reporting - September 2021 Rogan took to Instagram on September 1 to inform his followers that he had contracted Covid, but had beaten the virus quickly. The unvaccinated Rogan said he had taken a multitude of treatments, including anti-parasitic drug Ivermectin, monoclonal antibodies (antibodies created in a lab to fight a specific infection) and NAD drips (atype of intravenous treatment that can stimulate cell regeneration in your body).  But news broadcaster CNN reported that Rogan had taken 'horse dewormer' as a treatment for Covid instead of getting vaccinated. He claims the medical cocktail helped him recover and joked that he might 'sue CNN' for slamming his use and promotion of Ivermectin. 'They're making s*** up. They keep saying I'm taking horse dewormer. I literally got it from a doctor. It's an American company. They must know that's a lie.' 'It's a lie on a news network… and it's a lie that they're conscious of. It's not a mistake. They're unfavorably framing it as veterinary medicine.' 'Why would you say that when you're talking about a drug that's been given out to billions and billions of people?'  Rogan holds Biden administration's chief medical advisor Dr Anthony Fauci to account over mixed messaging on Covid measures - August 17, 2021: JRE #1696 with Lex Fridman In an August podcast withMIT research scientist and artificial intelligence researcher Lex Fridman, Rogan ripped into Fauci for a lack of transparency and mixed messaging over Covid measures. 'There's a problem with people like [Fauci] where they make these statements that you're led to believe they have an understanding of the situation… But then it turns out they're 100 percent wrong. 'But then they come up with a new statement and you're supposed to believe that.' 'When they don't know, they never say ''We don't know,'' Rogan added. 'They don't say ''this is very confusing and we're trying to figure it out as we go along.""' Fauci initially told Americans not to worry about wearing face masks early in the pandemic, before later becoming a huge supporter of public masking and blaming his previous advice on a need to conserve then-tight PPE supplies for medical staff. Fauci has also faced criticism for initially steering conversation away from claims that Covid may have leaked from the Wuhan virus lab, despite a considerable amount of evidence in support of the theory. Rogan says that introducing vaccine passports is moving one step closer to dictatorship and blasts lockdowns - August 6, 2021: JRE #1693 with Evin Hafer Rogan blasted vaccine passports in an August episode of his podcast with Black Rifle Coffee CEO and former green beret Evin Hafer. 'When you give people freedom, you let people do whatever the f*** they want to do, they actually find ways to succeed and grow and thrive,' Rogan said. 'But as soon as you put the boots to them, as soon as you tell them, ''You have to do this, or you can't do that. You have to listen to me,'' now you have a mini dictator. 'You have one step away from a king. One step closer. You're moving one step closer to dictatorship. 'That's what the f*** is happening.' Rogan days earlier blasted enforced lockdowns and criticized Australia in particular for its heavy handed approach. 'They have full on government lockdowns, where the government is flying helicopters over streets saying, ''Go back indoors, you're not allowed to be outside'', which is crazy. 'This disease doesn't even transmit well outside. It doesn't make any sense. Being outside and getting vitamin D from the sun is probably one of the best things you can do. Several studies have suggested that vitamin D deficiency may increase the risk of Covid-19 infection and the likelihood of severe disease. Rogan says he is not an anti-vaxxer but discourages young, healthy people from getting the vaccine - April 2021 In podcast #1642 with comedian Andrew Santino, Rogan said: 'I'm not an anti-vaxx person. I said I believe they're safe and I encourage many people to take them. 'My parents were vaccinated. I just said that if you're a young, healthy person that you don't need it.' His comments came days after a podcast with comedian Dave Smith in which Rogan said he would not advise healthy people aged 21 to get the vaccine. 'If you're like 21 years old, and you say to me, should I get vaccinated? I'll go no. 'If you're a healthy person, and you're exercising all the time, and you're young, and you're eating well, like, I don't think you need to worry about this.'"
20,'I thought I was marrying someone who swore to protect and serve - I got a crazed lunatic': Husband of ex-NYPD officer who tried to hire a hitman to have him killed fears she'll finish the job if freed from jail,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10470549/Husband-ex-NYPD-officer-tried-hire-hitman-killed-stage-death.html,"The ex-husband of a fired NYPD officer who tried to have him bumped off by a hitman has spoken out about his fear that she will carry out her 'crazed' plot once released from prison. Valerie Cincinelli, 37, was jailed for four years last November after being arrested in 2019 for the murder-for-hire scheme, but she may be released on good behavior within a matter of months. Cincinelli pleaded guilty last April to obstruction of justice as part of an agreement with federal prosecutors - but themurder-for-hire charges were dropped. Isaiah Carvalho, 34, worries that once his ex-wife is released, she may try to have him whacked. 'I look over my shoulder constantly. Not a day goes by I'm not afraid for my life.' Carvalho told of his shock and surprise at finding out the woman he was married to for five years, and had a son with, was behind the sickening plot to end his life. 'I thought I was marrying someone who swore to protect and serve, a cop. Instead, I got a crazed lunatic,' Carvalho told Inside Edition on Wednesday. The FBI found out about the plan to bump him off after Cincinelli's boyfriend, tasked with recruiting a hitman to carry out the killing, went to the feds instead. Her estranged husband then had to stage his own death in order to convince Cincinelli the hitman had done his job. But it wasn't until the fired NYPD officer was locked up that all the details were revealed to him. During 2019, when the couple were going through an acrimonious divorce, Cincinelli put her 'sugar daddy' boyfriend, John DiRubba, 57, in charge of hiring a hitman for $7,000, he said. The money was converted into gold to make it 'untraceable.' Carvalho said he thinks his wife thought that she might get away with the crime. 'I really believe she did. She went through with it. Took gold coins out. She had every intention of going through with it,' he told the program. Cincinelli's alleged plan came undone after she decided to add another victim to her list: DiRubba's own 13-year-old daughter, whom she was said to be jealous of because her father would buy her pricey presents. DiRubba told police about the plot after being arrested for an unrelated crime. He then cooperated with them to ensnare Cincinelli. On the day of the assassination,Carvalho worked withDiRubba and the FBI to set up an elaborate crime scene. He was taken to a secret location and asked to pose hunched over in a car with broken glass scattered over him so they could dupe Cincinelli into thinking her hit man had been successful. 'It was absolutely insane... it was the craziest thing I've ever had to experience,' he said. 'The FBI told me to sit in the car. They took glass they put it all on the floor and told me to hunch over into the passenger seat,' Carvalho explained. An undercover detective then went to Cincinelli's home on Long Island to show her the photos and told her she needed to send an additional $3,000 to kill her boyfriend's daughter. A photo was then shown to Cincinelli as proof of her ex's death. Cincinelli sobbed when she was told about the 'death' but hidden devices then recorded her response after the detectives left her home. She quickly began discussing her 'alibi' with the boyfriend. Soon afterwards, the FBI swooped in on her home and she was arrested. Cincinelli had joined the New York police department in 2007 and worked out of the Queens 106th Precinct, in Ozone Park. However, she was stripped of her badge and gun and placed on modified assignment in 2017 following a number of domestic incidents, an official said."
21,"Woman claims she was catfished by her FEMALE BOSS for WEEKS: Says employer used burner phone to masquerade as a male love interest, arranging and canceling multiple dates, and even sending her flowers ",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-10468947/Woman-claims-catfished-female-BOSS-pretended-man-using-burner-phone-weeks.html,"A woman has claimed that she was catfished by her female boss - who pretended to be a man using a burner phone for weeks, asked her to go on multiple dates, and even sent her flowers. Olivia Fenton, an actress from New York City, said that her manager said she wanted to 'set her up with her best guy friend' and helped them get in contact with one another. However, after weeks of talking to the man and unsuccessfully trying to meet up - she was shocked to discover that he wasn't real, and it was actually her manager the entire time. Mortified, Olivia opened up about the ordeal on TikTok where it quickly went viral - gaining more than three million views in a matter of days - and many people found it to be unsettling. According to Olivia, she became suspicious after the man stood her up on multiple occasions. She said they tried to go on a date three different times, but he never showed up to any of them. He used excuses like getting stuck in meetings at work, subway delays, and on their third attempt to meet up - he even claimed that he came to the bar and didn't see her, so he left. Eventually, she had enough and told her manager that she had given the man a chance, but it wasn't going to work between them. But the guy then texted her and asked for one more shot. She agreed, but was left disappointed when he once again skipped out on their plans - this time, claiming that he couldn't make it because he had been in a car accident. Olivia said she started to 'put the pieces together' that it was secretly her manager, after she received flowers from the guy, and noticed that the handwriting matched her boss'. She claimed her manager tricked her by using photos of 'some random gay guy from Georgia.' 'Catfished by my own boss! Has this also happened to any of you NYC girlies out there? I must know' she captioned the video. In a follow up, she explained that as soon as she uncovered the truth, she went to HR who 'handled it immediately' and fired her manager. 'I also found out she did this to a woman at her previous company,' she added. As for why she did it, Olivia said she believes her manager 'is deeply in the closet and still coming to terms with her sexuality.' 'I think she might have had a crush on me and took it way too far,' she concluded. Many people took to the comment section of Olivia's videos to share their dismay, with one writing, 'People are insane. Glad HR jumped on it immediately.' 'I've been a manager for 30 years and would never even consider setting my employee up on a date,' someone else said. 'That should've been your first red flag. Yikes.' Another added: 'Listen, as a former closeted lesbian, there's coming to terms with your identity and then there's this...' 'D**n she could've just asked you on a date and kept her job,' a fourth comment read. 'That's not a ""in the closet"" thing, that's a ""needs to see a therapist ASAP"" thing,' a different user agreed. Others even claimed that Olivia's situation was so bizarre, they thought it was the plot of a movie or book. 'I thought this was one of those book ads,' someone joked. 'I kept waiting for you to drop the title.' 'I actually thought this was a book that you were marketing,' another TikTok user wrote. 'It's giving Lifetime movie [vibes],' one person commented."
22,"PICTURED: Female deputy, 30, shot dead by her detective boyfriend before he turned gun on himself while they vacationed in a Florida rental with other cops ",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10469767/Female-deputy-30-shot-dead-boyfriend-killed-vacation-Florida.html,"The deputy who was shot dead by her detective boyfriend in a murder-suicide while they were on vacation in St. Augustine, Florida has been identified. Abigail Bieber, 30, was found dead inside a St. Augustine rental home in the Butler Beach area early Sunday morning alongside her boyfriend, Det. Daniel Leyden, who was also pronounced dead from an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound. A preliminary investigation revealed that Hillsborough Sheriff's Office Detective Daniel Leyden shot and killed Bieber - who worked as a deputy at the sheriff's office - before turning the gun on himself. Other deputies who were on vacation with the couple said they heard arguing from a bedroom before shots rang out at around 10pm Saturday night, according to News 4 Jacksonville. And neighbors they saw deputies evacuating people through the second-story window of the vacation rental and calling for a man inside to come out with his hands on his head, the Tampa Bay Timesreports. The St. Johns County Sheriff's Office's investigation into the murder-suicide is ongoing, even as Bieber's body was transported in a hearse back home on Wednesday with officers lining the streets as it went by. Bieber had worked at the Hillsborough County Sheriff's Office, assigned to Uniform Patrol, since February 2018. She frequently responded to calls about sexual battery and child abuse, according to the sheriff's office, and aspired to become a detective within the Criminal Investigations Special Victims Section. 'Deputy Abigail Bieber was an outstanding law enforcement officer, and by all accounts an even better person who left a positive impact on every member of her squad and the countless members of our community who she encountered while on patrol,' Hillsborough County Sheriff Chad Chronister said in a statement. 'This tragedy has left our Sheriff's Office family grief-stricken. There is a void within our hearts that can never be filled, but I hope that Deputy Bieber's legacy will be the way she lived her life - as a selfless servant.' Co-workers remembered Bieber as a young woman with a positive attitude who never shied away from a tough investigation. Retired Hillsborough Lt. Andrew Baxter also told the Tampa Bay Times that Bieber used to work the midnight shift under his command, noting that supervisors across the agency respected her work and were always trying to get her on their shifts. 'She had the respect of her supervisors, and that's kind of touch to do when you're that young in your career,' he said, recounting how he used to always joke with her whenever they saw each other in the break room. While he usually ate some sort of fast food, she would always heat up a healthy, home-cooked meal. The fact that she died at the hands of another officer, Baxter said, 'was personal on a few different levels. 'She's an angel on Earth, essentially, and she was brutally murdered by another one of us,' he said. 'And it's not an easy pill to swallow.' Former Hillsborough deputy Erika Delgado also described Bieber as a good friend and a good listener, saying: 'If you needed something, doesn't matter what, you could just call her up.' She said Bieber had recently purchased a single-family house in northeast Clearwater, and her two German shepherds, Louis and Pepper, were her 'babies.' Following the news of Bieber's death, Delgado said, dozens of deputies gathered to remember her over drinks. They left one drink aside for Bieber, with a note scribbled on a napkin, saying: 'This one's for you. We got it from here. We miss you.' "
23,Drug dealer who actor Michael K. Williams bought fentanyl-laced heroin from that killed him was a repeat offender released under NYC's bail reforms,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10469647/Four-people-arrested-supplying-drugs-actor-Michael-K-Williams-overdosed-NYC.html,"The man accused of selling actor Michael K. Williams a deadly batch of fentanyl-laced heroin was a repeat offender released under the state's bail reforms, according to reports. Irvin Cartegena - who prosecutors say peddled the drugs that killed Williams last September - was arrested on a drug sale and weapon possession sale in August 2020 and nabbed again last February for possession of a controlled substance. He was let back onto the streets without bail both times under New York's bail reform provisions. The drug charges were combined last August and Cartegena avoided jailtime by pleading guilty to disorderly conduct, the Daily Beast reported. Prosecutors on Wednesday announced the arrest of Cartagena, 39, and three co-conspirators related to the 54-year-old actor's accidental fentanyl poisoning. Cartagena was arrested in Puerto Rico. Hector Robles, 57, Luis Cruz, 56, and Carlos Macci, 70, all from Brooklyn, were also arrested Tuesday in New York. Officials said the four men were part of a drug trafficking organization since August 2020, operating in the Williamsburg neighborhood of Brooklyn. Their ring primarily focused on fentanyl and heroin-laced fentanyl as they sold the drugs outside their apartment, where Cartagena, known as 'Green Eyes,' met up with Williams on September 5, 2021, to allegedly sell him the drugs. Video surveillance captured the moment Cartagena handed off the drugs to Williams a day before the actor died.   The actor, who gained fame with as drug dealer Omar Little in The Wire, was found the following day by his nephew unconscious and facedown in the living room of Williams' Williamsburg apartment. He was declared dead by medics who rushed to the scene. All four men were charged with conspiracy to distribute and possess with intent to distribute fentanyl analogue, fentanyl, and heroin, which carries a maximum prison sentence of 40 years. Cartagena was also charged with causing the death of Williams, which carries a mandatory minimum sentence of 20 years in prison. New York Police Department Commissioner Keechant Sewell said detectives have been working hard on the case since September in order to help bring justice to Williams and his family. 'As these federal charges show, the NYPD's narcotics and precinct detectives in Brooklyn North lived this case, never relenting in their investigation until they could bring a measure of justice to Michael K. Williams and his family,' Sewell said. U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York Damian Williams said he was proud of the arrests made and echoed the importance of ending America's opioid crisis. 'This is a public health crisis. And it has to stop,' he said. 'Deadly opioids like fentanyl and heroin don't care about who you are or what you've accomplished. They just feed addiction and lead to tragedy. The Southern District of New York and our law enforcement partners will not give up. We will bring every tool to bear. And we will continue to hold accountable the dealers who push this poison, exploit addiction, and cause senseless death.' Although Williams' fatal overdose was originally ruled an accident, NYPD Deputy Chief John Chell had instructed the 90th Precinct Detective Squad and Brooklyn North Narcotics Group, who were in charge of the investigation, to treat the death as a homicide. According to the Daily Beast'sinvestigation in the final day of Williams life, the actor drove off from Manhattan to Williamsburg on September 5. Footage from street cameras showed Williams coming up on the street where Cartagena and his associates allegedly ran their drug trafficking operation. When he reached the apartment, Williams could be seen walking up to five men on the street, with one of them identified as Cartagena. Williams handed the man a wad of cash, and Cartagena could be seen counting the bills before reaching into a paper bag stashed beside a blue recycling can in front of the apartment. Prosecutors said that was when Cartagena handed Williams the heroin laced with fentanyl that would kill him the following day. Fentanyl is a powerful synthetic opioid that is similar to morphine but is 50 to 100 times more potent. It can cause death when taken in high doses or when combined with other substances. Detectives noted that the men appeared relaxed through the entire transaction, exchanging phone numbers and chatting, completely unaware that it was all being captured by cameras. 'The building has these cameras pointing directly on them the whole day long,' Detective Mark Gurleski told Daily Beast. Williams then drove home to his apartment, making no stops along the way. Detectives also noted that Williams appeared to behave oddly during his final hours, parking his car at a prohibited area at his residence despite neighbors describing him as 'responsible' and 'considerate.' Chell called it 'very uncharacteristic.' Police said their timeline for Williams ended just as he stepped off at his penthouse, missing a call from his nephew, Dominic DuPont, who checked up on his uncle the following day to find him dead. According to the investigation documents filed by Gurleski to the Department of Justice, police had moved in quickly on Cartagena, identifying him just a day later. Investigators then purchased drugs from him on two separate occasions, once on September 8, and then again a week later on September 15. The drugs were handed off inside envelopes that read 'AAA Insurance' matching the one that was found on Williams when he died. Investigators then built up their case against Cartagena, seeking out his fellow co-conspirators before finally arresting them on Tuesday."
24,AOC tells Schumer to make Sinema's life 'as difficult as possible' after moderate who killed Build Back Better and Biden's voting rights plan complained Senate votes were too slow ,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10470027/AOC-tells-Schumer-make-Sinemas-life-difficult-possible.html,"Squad member Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez took aim at centrist Sen. Kyrsten Sinema on Wednesday, calling on party leadership to make her life as difficult as possible - highlighting the bitter divide among Democrats over their direction. Sinema has become a hate figure for the left of the party for blocking Biden's multi-trillion dollar Build Back Better plan and killing off voter rights proposals. On Tuesday evening she was heard telling Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer to speed up a floor vote in the chamber. It brought an angry retort from Ocasio-Cortez a day later. 'Actually he should continue to make their lives as difficult as possible and treat them the way they treat, say, public housing residents,' she wrote on Twitter. 'Or parents who rely on [child tax credits]. When they improve, maybe process can improve too. 'Why should we make the lives of obstructionists easier?' Sinema is a favorite target of the leftwing New Yorker. She has accused her of protecting of the rich and questioned why she should continue to represent Arizona in the Senate. She is not alone. Sen. Bernie Sanders on Sunday said he would support a primary challenge to Sinema and to Sen. Joe Manchin - the other Democrat to oppose key elements of President Joe Biden's agenda - in West Virginia. But Ocasio-Cortez went further in calling for a war of inconvenience on Sinema. 'Cancel vacation. Vote on weekends. Vote for hours. Vote last minute,' she wrote. 'Call votes when senators are courting billionaires at fundraisers. 'They may get apoplectic, but it's nothing compared to the people they're forcing to sleep without heat in winter, or losing the right to vote.' A day earlier, an keen-eared reporter with Bloomberg News heard Sinema confront Schumer about the chamber's slow-moving voting procedure. She asked 'Could we have some discipline in the votes, ever? 'You’re in charge!' After Schumer spoke to her in an apparent attempt to mollify the exasperated senator from Arizona, she could be heard to say, 'Fine,' before leaving the chamber. The rift between progressives and moderates has undermined Biden's agenda With the Senate balanced 50-50, party leaders needed all its senators to back Biden's Build Back Better bill. Key provisions were stripped from its domestic policy and green energy plans to keep Manchin and Sinema on board. But in the event, Manchin eventually said he could not back the version of the bill passed by the House. Sinema's decision not to support a filibuster carveout to pass Biden's voting rights bill caused more anger last month. She announced her opposition just before Biden arrived on Capitol Hill in a final effort to persuade hold-out senators to back his plans. That brought her the censure of her local party and the anger of congressional colleagues. Ocasio-Cortez has missed no opportunity to criticize her. 'I don't believe she's really given a compelling case as to why she should be re-nominated as the Democratic nominee for United States Senate in Arizona,' she told MSNBC last month when asked by host Mehdi Hasan whether she would support primary challenges against Sinema and Manchin 'She has proven herself an obstacle to the right to vote in the United States.' Manchin and Sinema are up for reelection in 2024. And even Schumer on Wednesday dodged a question about whether he support their campaigns."
25,AOC insists it's no 'mystery' Congress won't ban members from trading stock and 'wouldn't be surprised' if the MAJORITY buy and sell shares after Nancy Pelosi ruled out a ban,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10469395/AOC-insists-no-mystery-Congress-wont-ban-members-trading-stock.html,"Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said it's 'not a mystery' why legislation banning members of Congress from trading individual stock has not yet passed despite swelling public support, and estimated that a 'majority' of Congress trade stocks. 'An enormous amount - I wouldn’t be surprised if it was a majority of members of Congress - hold and trade individual stock,' the New York Democrat told Yahoo Finance. 'It’s not really a mystery to me why it’s difficult to pass' the legislation, she added. A push to ban lawmakers from trading stocks has gained momentum after a number of questionable trades prompted ethics concerns. 'Even last year there was at least 75 members of Congress that held individual stock in Johnson & Johnson, Moderna and Pfizer,' the congresswoman added. At least 75 members of Congress did hold shares in the three pharmaceutical companies that developed a Covid-19 vaccine, even as they voted on legislation to allocate billions on developing and distributing the vaccine. 'That is where we should be drawing the line,' Ocasio-Cortez said. 'I am a member of Congress. Members of Congress have access to very sensitive security clearances, access to very detailed, tailored briefings. Our job is to try to anticipate and legislate for what we see is coming. We should not have the ability to both have access to that information and to hold and trade in individual stock.' Ocasio-Cortez said lawmakers would still be able to put their money in retirement funds, college savings accounts, blind trusts, index or mutual funds - any sort of account they don't have direct control over. Lawmakers bought and sold shares worth over $355 million last year, according to a Capitol Trades analysis of disclosures compiled by MarketWatch. At least 113 of the 535 members of Congress filed paperwork disclosing stock transactions in the past year. They bought an estimated $180 million in stock and sold $175 million. And despite swelling support for an ethical revamp, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi squashed any idea that she will rally her caucus for such legislation. 'We're a free market economy,' Pelosi told reporters during a news conference on Dec. 15. 'They [lawmakers] should be able to participate in that.' She doubled down on her position in a news conference last week. 'I do come down always in favor of trusting our members,' the House Speaker said during her weekly briefing on Thursday. 'Now if the impression that is given by some that somebody's doing insider trading – that's a Justice Department issue,' she continued. 'And that has no place in any of this.' 'But to give a blanket attitude of we can't do this and we can't do that because we can't be trusted. I just don't buy into that. But if members want to do that, I'm OK with that.' In December, Paul Pelosi disclosed that bought millions in tech stock. Over the course of five days, Paul Pelosi purchased stock worth anywhere between $1,750,007 and $3,600,000 - shares in Alphabet, Disney, Salesforce, Roblox, Reoff XX and Micron Technologies. Pelosi and her husband Paul are known as some of the most prolific traders of all time. Social trading app Iris draws in customers who can track their trades and mimic them for themselves. Asked about the recent trades, Pelosi's chief of staff and spokesperson Drew Hammill said that they had all been made by the speaker's husband and she did 'not own any stocks herself. ' 'The Speaker has no prior knowledge or subsequent involvement in any transactions,' Hammill told DailyMail.com. He also pointed to 2012 legislation, the STOCK Act, which prohibits members of Congress from using 'any nonpublic information derived from the individual's position ... or gained from performance of the individual's duties, for personal benefit.' It also required lawmakers to report any publicly disclose any transaction of stocks, bond, commodities futures, and other securities within 45 days, rather than once per year. 'The STOCK Act exists to shine a bright light on trades by Members of Congress. Sunlight is the best disinfectant,' Hammill said. However, Pelosi's trades only rank as eighth-largest in Congress in 2021. At the top of the list for the biggest traders on Capitol Hill is Rep. Michael McCaul, R-Texas, who bought $31 million and sold $35 million, according to MarketWatch. Behind him is Rep. Rho Khanna, D-Calif., with $34 million in stock buys and $19 million in sales, Rep. Mark Greene, R-Tenn., who had $26 million in estimated purchases and $26 million in sales. Ocasio-Cortez in December called the notion of trading while in Congress 'ludicrous.' 'The access and influence we have should be exercised for the public interest, not our profit,' Ocasio-Cortez wrote on Twitter earlier this month. Walter Shaub, director of the U.S. Office of Government and Ethics under President Obama, said that Pelosi is '100% wrong' for saying members of Congress should be able to hold stock because the U.S. is a 'free market economy.' 'GOOD GRIEF! NO! She's wrong. She is 100% wrong. Nobody put a gun to anyone's head and said ""you must be a member of Congress."" Want to trade stocks? Do it. Want to be a member of Congress? Do it. But you have NO BUSINESS doing both! This is the opposite of government ethics,' Shaub wrote on Twitter. Freshman Democratic Sen. John Ossoff, D-Ga., and Sen. Mark Kelly, D-Ariz., are co-sponsoring legislation that would require members of Congress, their spouses and dependent children to place their stock portfolios into a blind trust, as Ossoff did last year. Violators would face fines up to the amount of their salary. Ossoff told reporters Wednesday that he is courting the support of Republicans, and has spoken to a dozen GOP senators about signing on to his bill. He said at least eight Republicans in the House are already on board. A similar bill to Ossoff's was introduced by Reps. Abigail Spanberger, D-Va., and Chip Roy, R-Texas.in the Senate in March, the Ban Conflicted Trading Act. However, its trading ban only extends to members of Congress and their staff, excluding Ossoff's limits on spouses and other family. That means if passed, Pelosi's husband, Paul Pelosi, would be able to continue his prolific trading activity. A third bill similar to the one in March was brought forth by Sen. Josh Hawley.  In 2018, Sen. Elizabeth Warren introduced a bill to ban members of Congress and White House staff from owning individual stocks, and reintroduced the legislation in 2020. In early 2020 a number of lawmakers came under fire for making trades after a private briefing on the impending devastation of coronavirus. None were criminally charged, but Sen. Richard Burr, R-N.C., lost his spot on the Senate Intelligence Committee and is currently under investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission."
26,'BLM's house of cards is starting to fall': Indiana AG says 'scam' organization that has $60m is causing him 'concern' but declines to say if he's launched an investigation after California DoJ went after the leaders,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10470425/Indiana-attorney-general-says-BLMs-house-cards-starting-fall-amid-financial-questions.html,"The Indiana attorney general slammed Black Lives Matteras a falling 'house of cards' before the activist group shut down all of its fundraising websites late Wednesday afternoon. The move comes as BLM was forbidden to collect donations in California and Washingtondue to its 'lack of financial transparency,' but reportedly continued to do so.  IndianaAttorney General Todd Rokita compared BLM to an 'illegal enterprise' following a typical pattern of financial scheming. 'It appears that the house of cards may be falling, and this happens eventually with nearly every scam, scheme, or illegal enterprise,' Rokita, a Republican, told the newspaper. 'I see patterns that scams kind of universally take: failure to provide board members, failure to provide even executive directors, failure to make your filings available. It all leads to suspicion.' Although Rokita would not confirm if Indiana is investigating BLM, he noted reports on the organization's undisclosed finances 'certainly cause us to be concerned'. The attorney general's remarks followed a letter fromCaliforniaDepartment of Justice threatening that BLM leaders could be held personally liable if they fail to disclose financial records about the charity's $60 million in donations within the next 60 days. Thewarning follows an order from Washington state instructing BLM to'immediately cease' fundraising in the state due to its 'lack of financial transparency'. 'BLMGNF is prohibited from soliciting donations so long as its status is listed as delinquent,' the California Department of Justice told the newspaper.The charity could face fines upwards of $2,000 for each contribution received while being out of compliance. However, a man in Washington state man confirmed to the Washington Examinerthat he was able to donate $1 to the group on Monday and a California reporter was able to make a $1 donation Wednesday. Insiders also allege BLM's charity registration is out of compliance in Connecticut, Maine, Maryland, New Jersey, North Carolina and Virginia. In a letter dated Monday, California AG Rob Bontaaccused the organization of failing to submit its annual financial reports and alleged it was in delinquent status. 'An organization that is delinquent, suspended or revoked is not in good standing and is prohibited from engaging in conduct for which registration is required, including soliciting or disbursing charitable funds,' the letter reads. The DOJ requested a copy of BLM's annual registration renewal fee report and its 2020 IRS tax forms within two months time. If the organization fails to submit these documents, its charity exemption status will be revoked. It could also face fines for 'each month or partial month for which the report(s) are delinquent.' The letter, which was obtained by the Washington Examiner, threatened that 'directors, trustees, officers and return preparers' would be 'personally liable' for 'all penalties, interest and other costs incurred to restore exempt status'. The DOJ notes that 'charitable assetscannot be used to pay these avoidable costs'. The notice comes just days after it was revealed that BLM has not had anyone in charge of its finances since co-founder Patrisse Cullors resigned last May. It is not clear who is currently in charge of the activist group after all three of its founding members - Cullors, Alicia Garza and Opal Tometi - left the organization. Cullors, 38, stepped down as executive director of the Black Lives Matter Global Network (BLMGN) in 2021 amid scrutiny of her $3.2 million property empire. The scrutiny into the charity's finances also comes after it was reported that the group transferred $6.3 million to Cullors' spouse, Janaya Khan, and other Canadian activists to purchase a mansion in Toronto in 2001. In February 2021, BLM reported it closed out the previous year with $60 million in donations, however the charity has not had anyone in charge of its finances since co-founderPatrisse Cullors resigned last May. BLM's mostrecent tax filing, from 2019, provided an address in Los Angeles that does not exist, and the two remaining BLM directors identified by The Washington Examiner were not able to assist - with one even scrubbing BLM associations from his social media after he was contacted by the paper. They are yet to file a 2020 return, a Form 990, as required - which could see BLM fined by the IRS. Laurie Styron, executive director of CharityWatch, said the findings were deeply troubling, and said they should have filed their 2020 form by now. 'Like a giant ghost ship full of treasure drifting in the night with no captain, no discernible crew, and no clear direction,' she said. Paul Kamenar, an attorney with theNational Legal and Policy Center - a conservative watchdog group - added that a full audit was needed, describing the situation as 'grossly irregular'. He is reportedly preparing to file a complaint against the charity. 'The National Legal and Policy Center will be filing a formal complaint with the Attorneys General of Washington and California to impose the maximum penalties on BLMGNF for their flagrant and repeated violations of the charity disclosure laws in those states and it seems in many others,' Kamenar confirmed Tuesday. Experts allege the problem began in earnest in May 2021, when Cullors stepped down as director of BLMGN, the national body representing all the individual local chapters. Cullors co-founded BLM in July 2013, after a Florida jury acquitted George Zimmerman in the killing of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin. Alicia Garza, an Oakland activist, posted what she called a love letter to black people on Facebook, writing, 'Our lives matter.' Cullors, a friend of Garza, replied with the hashtag #BlackLivesMatter. New York activist Opal Tometi then used the words while building a digital network of community organizers and antiracism activists. Garza and Tometi are no longer affiliated with the network, and Cullors was its figurehead and leader throughout the George Floyd protests - which saw huge donations flood in. The organization's finances had been managed by a group called Thousand Currents, which says it has a 'mission of supporting grassroots movements pushing for a more just and equitable world.' In the summer of 2020,leaders sought nonprofit status with the IRS, which was granted in December 2020 - allowing the organization to receive tax-deductible donations directly.The designation requires the foundation to file public 990 forms, revealing details of its organizational structure, employee compensation, programming and expenses. In September 2020, Cullors signed documents with Thousand Currents transferring $66.5 million into BLM's accounts. In February 2021, Black Lives Matter confirmed it took in $90 million throughout 2020, distributed to their partner organizations, and had $60 million remaining in its accounts. In its report, a snapshot of which was shared withAP, the BLM foundation said individual donations via its main fundraising platform averaged at $30.76 each.More than 10 percent of the donations were recurring. The report does not state who gave the money in 2020, and leaders declined to name prominent donors. Expenses were approximately $8.4 million — that includes staffing, operating and administrative costs, along with activities such as civic engagement, rapid response and crisis intervention. BLM said at the time that they were sharing the details in a bid to be more transparent - admitting that their structure and finances had previously been opaque. But two months later, in April 2021, reports began emerging - provided bythe National Legal and Policy Center - which showed Cullors had amassed a$3.2 million property empire. Cullors owned four properties - three in the Los Angeles area and one outside of Atlanta - the researchers found. Many within BLM turned against Cullors, questioning where she had accumulated the money. Cullors has written two books, has a deal with YouTube, and signed a production deal with Warner Bros. in 2020 to develop programming 'for children, young adults and families.' However, amid the furor she stood down and announced that two people were taking over as executive directors -Makani Themba and Monifa Bandele. Yet Themba and Bandele in September said that they had never taken up the roles, following disagreements with leadership. 'Although a media advisory was released indicating that we were tapped to play the role of senior co-executives at BLMGN, we were not able to come to an agreement with the acting Leadership Council about our scope of work and authority,' they said in a statement. 'As a result, we did not have the opportunity to serve in this capacity.' Themba and Bandele said they did not know who was now running BLM, as their discussions never progressed. Two other people remained on the board, after Cullors' departure - Shalomyah Bowers and Raymond Howard, according to undated documents obtained by The Washington Examiner. Bowers served as the treasurer for multiple activist organizations run by Cullors, The Washington Examiner reported, including BLM PAC and a Los Angeles-based jail reform group that paid Cullors $20,000 a month and spent nearly $26,000 on 'meetings' at a luxury Malibu beach resort in 2019. Bowers has not commented on the current status of the $60 million in the BLM coffers. Howard also refused to comment when asked by the paper, and has since updated his LinkedIn page to remove references to his work with 'an international social justice organization'. Meanwhile,Cullors has been tied to even more charities whose finances raise 'red flags' after the organization donated hundreds of thousands to the nonprofits which then made payments to Cullors and her business partners, according to a new report on the organization's spending. One of the groups, Reform LA Jails that Cullors founded, had received $1.4 million, of which $205,000 went to the consulting firm owned by Cullors and her spouse, Janaya Khan, New York Magazine reported. Reform LA Jails then gave $270,000 to Christman Bowers, treasurer of the Black Lives Matter PAC; $211,000 to Asha Bandelle, a friend of Cullors' who co-wrote her memoir; and another $86,000 to Trap Heals LLC, an entertainment, clothing and consulting company started by Damon Turner, the father of Cullors' child."
27,JFK's VERY underwhelming Harvard application goes viral after his grandson graduated from the Ivy League school: Twitter mocks entitled essay about wanting to attend same college as his dad ,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-10468475/JFKs-application-essay-Harvard-not-impressive.html,"This weekend, President John F. Kennedy's youngest grandchild, Jack Schlossberg, celebrated his graduation from Harvard, where he earned dual graduate degrees in law and business — a feat that no doubt required hard work and endless hours of studying. But getting into Harvard at all is certainly easier with money, connections, and a family history — and that was especially true when JFK himself enrolled in 1935. In light of his 29-year-old grandson's accomplishment, Twitter users are returning to records of JFK's application to Harvard, which included an incredibly lackluster high school transcript, a letter from his Harvard alum father, and a short essay from JFK himself. The essay, which was handwritten, explained that JFK wanted to go to Harvard because 'it is not just another college' — and he dreamed of being a 'Harvard man' just like his dad. Digital copies of Kennedy's application materials have been made available by theThe Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum. Upon graduating from the wealthy Connecticut private school Choate in 1935,Kennedy initially intended to follow in his brother Joe's footsteps and attend theLondon School of Economics. But he returned to the US in ill health due to his struggles withAddison's disease. He then enrolled closer to home at Princeton University, but withdrew again after only two months due to his health. Finally, he ended up at Harvard — and appears to have had a particularly easy time getting in despite a less-than-impressive academic record. Included in his application was a high school transcript, which showed mostly C, D, and F grades. He performed best in English, earning Cs, but flunked several years of French, freshman year Latin. Earning particular attention this week is a short paragraph, handwritten on the bottom half of an application page in response to the question, 'Why do you wish to come to Harvard?' In parentheses, the application adds: 'The Committee will expect a careful answer to this question.' JFK, who grew up with wealth inin Brookline, Massachusetts and Riverdale, New York, wrote that he wanted to attend Harvard because it was a good school and his father went there. 'The reasons that I have for wishing to go to Harvard are several,' he began. 'I feel that Harvard can give me a better background and a better liberal education than any other university. 'I have always wanted to go there, as I have felt that it is not just another college, but is a university with something definite to offer. 'Then too, I would like to go to the same college as my father. To be a ""Harvard man"" is an enviable distinction, and one that I sincerely hope I shall attain,' he concluded. The letter prompted quite a bit of coverage when it was first made available in2013, and it's now being widely shared one again — with mostly unfavorable reactions. 'All he said was 'Daddy went here and I really really wanna go here cause you know daddy went here and I wanna be a harvard man just like daddy,""' wrote one Twitter user. Another summed up his letter: 'Harvard is a whole vibe. And I'm tryna catch the wave. Lemme in.' Yet another translated, 'Reasons you should let me into Harvard: 1. I want to 2. I've wanted to for a long time 3. Whose name is going on the new library again? 4. You're so special 5. I don't know if you know this, but I want to.' Several commenters pointed out that Harvard admissions looked different at the time, and were mostly focused on protecting and promoting privilege among the wealthy. Explained one: '40% of Harvard students are legacy admissions and we don't talk about that enough. JFK's essay was garbage regardless of the time period.' 'I did a research project once where I studied at Ivy league entrance essays from the 20s-50s and all of them — literally ALL of them — were like they were written by 5 year olds,' said another. 'To be fair, you can’t fit all of that on the memo part of a check,' snipped a third, while a fourth said: 'Wish I had the money to write this poorly.' Though JFK's essay has raised eyebrows, his entire application is a fascinating illustration of how privilege won out in Harvard admissions at the time. These days, most students accepted to Harvard have not only earned straight-As but have a slew of extracurricular activities and other impressive accomplishments to boast. But JFK's high school transcripts show not a single A — and just a single B- (an 81 average) in sophomore year English. His other English averages were 76 (freshman year), 69 (junior year), and 71 (senior year). He earned a 62 and a 69 in freshman and sophomore year latin, respectively, and averages of 62, 73, 67 and 65 during his four years of French. He averaged 65 in elementary algebra, a 71 in intermediate algebra, and and 73 in plane geometry. He also earned a 77 in physics, a 75 in ancient history, and a 74 in English history. Out of 110 students, he finished just 65th in his class — yet he was still voted by his fellow students as Most Likely to Succeed. Among his application documents were also several letters of character reference — including one from his father, Joseph Kennedy, to Delmar Leighton, dean of freshmen. 'Jack has a very brilliant mind for the things in which he is interested, but is careless and lacks application in those in which he is not interested. This is, of course, a bad fault,' the Kennedy patriarch wrote in an effort to sway admissions in his son's favor. 'However, he is quite ambitious to try and do the work in three years,' he went on, indicating that JFK intended to do four years of work in just three. 'I know how the authorities feel about this and I have my own opinion, but it is a gesture that pleases me very much because it seems to be the beginning of anawakening ambition.' Harvard's application also requested the names and addresses of three references whom they could contact for more information. After contacting Kennedy family friendEdward E. Moore, he sent 'a statement in regard to the character' of JFK. 'I have known John all his life and have known his family for many years so that I have had the opportunity of seeing him develop at close hand,' the letter read. 'He has always enjoyed good health and has entered into sports with a great deal of vigor and sportsmanship. In this field, as well as in others, he has always shown an appreciation of a sense of fair play and honesty. In this I cannot speak too highly of him. 'In his work and in his life at home, he is reliable and dependable. Being one of a family of nine, he has had to give and take which has developed in a large way, the character which I have no hesitation of recommending,' he wrote. The Harvard application also asked to supply a photo and to list 'what sports or games do you especially like,' for which Kennedy listed football and crew. There was also a signed 'Principal's Report on Applicant' from his high school principal, who was asked to assert that 'I regard this candidate as a young man of good moral character.' Over 80 years later, JFK's grandson may have benefited from his legacy upon applying to Harvard Law, but he no doubt had a more impressive application to back himself up. And getting through Harvard's joint JD-MBA program was likely quite a challenge.In his first months there in 2017, Jack admitted to Boston.com that he was quite busy at the school. 'I don’t have a life, but that’s what I signed up for,' he said. 'It’s cool, you just get to learn all day. Sometimes it’s tough, but it’s been a fun experience. 'Harvard Law School is great. I’m lucky to be here. It’s a really difficult, intense experience. But I know so much more than I did the day before I got to law school, so that’s a cool feeling,' he added. Jack also admitted at the time that his favorite restaurants happened to be onJFK Street, which was 'humbling.' 'There’s no pretending that it’s not here when I’m at Harvard. The first few days it felt a little weird, but now I don’t think about it so much,' he said. At the time, Jack — who has two sisters, Rose, 33, and Tatiana, 31 — admitted he wasn't sure what he wanted to do with his career. 'I’m kind of hedging my bets,' he said. 'I’m not sure what I want to do — business, law, something else. 'I came into law school thinking I really wanted to practice environmental law, and so far my favorite class is in property, which is something I never would have expected. Come three years from now, my interests could be completely different. I’ll always be interested in climate issues, but my idea of what I want to do will probably change.' This weekend, he celebrated his graduation on Instagram, sharing a photo of himself holding Harvard-themed cupcakes andwearing a T-shirt with the letters 'Jdmbalfg,' which he also wrote in the caption. Jdmbalfg appears to reference his two degrees — a JD for law and an MBA for business — plus 'lfg,' a slang acronym for 'let's f***ing go.' Prior to obtaining his graduate degrees, he had attended the Collegiate School on Manhattan’s Upper West Side and Yale University, where he majored in history with a concentration in Japanese history. At Yale, he wrote for the Yale Daily News and The Yale Herald and spent a summerremoving toxic waste in Massachusetts before graduating in 2015. Between undergrad and grad school, he spent time working forthe U.S. Department of State. He also worked for a Japanese brewing, distilling, and beverage company called Suntory Holdings Limited, anda Japanese internet and e-commerce company called Rakuten, Inc. He also had a one-episode role in the season eight finale of Blue Bloods in 2018, when he was 25. A jack-of-all trades, Jack has been involved with other work over the years, including his helping with hisfamily's Profile in Courage Awards, working as aSenate page and intern, andworking for former Secretary of State John Kerry. He has also written forThe Washington Post, The New York Times, Time, and New York magazine’s The Cut. He's been involved in politics as well, and in 2016 wrote for Politico about remarks thatSenator Ted Cruz made about his grandfather under the title 'Ted Cruz Is No Jack Kennedy.' 'As Kennedy’s grandson, and as a student of his life, legacy and administration, I find this notion — and the suggestion that Ted Cruz is somehow taking up his mantle — absurd,' he wrote. 'Were my grandfather alive today, he’d be excited about how far we have come as a nation since 1963, he would feel a sense of urgency about the challenges that lie ahead and he most certainly would not be a Republican.' In 2020, he even spoke at the 2020 Democratic National Convention in support of President Biden. 'Times have changed, but the themes of my grandfather's speech — courage, unity, and patriotism — are as important today as they were in 1960,' he said. 'Once again, we need a leader who believes America's best days are yet to come. We need Joe Biden.'"
28,Expert warns that shoveling snow can be a deadly way to discover underlying cardiovascular conditions as straining the heart with physical activity could cause sudden death,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-10469799/Expert-warns-shoveling-snow-deadly-way-discover-underlying-heart-conditions.html,"Shoveling the driveway is might be the worst part of a winter snow day. One expert warns that it could even deadly. Dr John Bisognano,head of preventive cardiology at the University of Michigan Health Frankel Cardiovascular Center, warned that people who live stagnant lives could end up straining themselves to the point of death while shoveling snow. Many people may not know they are quietly suffering a heart condition and could write off symptoms like shortness of breath or chest pain. If someone has an unknown condition, does not regularly take part in physical activity, and attempts to take part in the strenuous activity, they could suffer a heart attack or go into cardiac arrest. The National Safety Council estimates that 100 people die every year from shoveling snow, almost all from a heart related condition. 'Many people haven't done a lot of exercise for the rest of the year and shoveling snow is not only a heavy exercise, but an exercise that really stresses the entire cardiovascular system,' Bisognano said in a university release. 'Sometimes shoveling snow brings out the underlying cardiovascular diseases people have, and it may be the first time they notice that their exercise capacity is not what it used to be the year prior.' Snow has slammed the nation in recent weeks, with the 'Nor'Easter' that struck the northeast last week dumping up to a foot of snow in some areas, and more storms still expected in the coming weeks. Bisognano has some tips to avoid the potential of the simple chore turning into a tragedy. First, he says to do a self-evaluation to determine whether you feel healthy and safe going out to shovel, especially if you are a person that is not in good shape. 'If you've been active and you haven't felt chest pain or shortness of breath, and you feel good today, shoveling is probably ok,' he said He also recommends to take things slowly at first, and to stop if you for any reason feel different from how you felt shoveling snow in previous years. People should also regularly stop to take a breath when they are tired, and if they are truly exhausted they should tap in another member of the household to complete the task instead. 'I know for many people you've been shoveling snow for years, you're used to this, you've been taking care of your house, but it's important to remember that shoveling snow provides an unusual stress on your body because it's cold, you're doing physical activity that starts abruptly and it may be something you haven't done for months in the past,' Bisognano said. When a person is feeling the early signs of a heart problem, they should also seek out medical attention instead of trying to weather it out at home. A person experiencing a heart attack or another severe heart issue is likely to survive if they quickly receive medical attention. Staying at home and trying to ride it out could be a deadly risk to take, though. 'Don't just sit at home with a little chest pressure, a little chest pain,' he said. 'That's the time to seek medical attention and to seek it quickly so that we can give you the therapies, the good medications, the good procedures, that can solve your short-term problem.' He also recommends for people to avoid shoveling snow if they have received treatment for a heart attack, heart failure or similar conditions before. 'Make sure not to push yourself any further than you’re comfortable with,' Bisognano said."
29,"'Devastated' CNN hosts DEFEND Jeff Zucker's illicit, career-ending affair with staffer Allison Gollust: Brian Stelter blames Chris Cuomo for outing him while Alisyn Camerota says he shouldn't resign",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10469755/CNN-hosts-defend-Jeff-Zucker-affair-say-SHOULDNT-resigned.html,"'Devastated' CNN journalists took to the air to defend Jeff Zucker on Wednesday after his resignation over his years-long secret romance with a staffer. Zucker announced on Wednesday that he was resigning, effective immediately, because he did not disclose to the network that he was involved with Allison Gollust, his friend and colleague of over 20 years. They claim their romance began during the pandemic, but sources tell DailyMail.com and other outlets that their secret relationship had started years earlier. Both Zucker, 56, and Gollust, 49, are divorced. Zucker and his wife Caryn split in 2018 and Gollust is understood to have separated from her husband Billy around the same time, if not earlier. They lived in the same apartment building with their respective families for years and the romance was well-known among CNN's staff, according to multiple people. On Wednesday afternoon, host Alisyn Camerota however defended the pair, saying there was nothing wrong with it because they are both 'executives'. Brian Stelter, CNN's media correspondent, blamed it all on Chris Cuomo, who exposed the romance through his attorneys while negotiating an exit-package. 'These are two consenting adults who are both executives.That they can't have a private relationship feels wrong,' she said to Stelter and Victor Blackwell. Scroll down for video 'I feel it deeply, personally, but I speak for all of us and our colleagues. This is an incredible loss. 'Jeff is a remarkable person and an incredible leader. He has this uncanny ability to makeevery one of us feel special and valuablein our own way, even though he is managing an internationalnews organization of thousands of people. 'I don't think that comes around all the time.It's an incredible loss. It's so regrettable. Camerota also told The Daily Beast: 'We are all devastated. Jeff is beloved here. We all know we'll never find a smarter or more compassionate boss.' Stelter said the entire thing was down to Cuomo and that he wanted to 'burn' the network down after being fired in November last year for helping his brother, former New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, navigate his own sex scandal. 'Chris Cuomo is not going out quietly.He was trying to burn the place down. 'He wasgoing to court, claiming he had incriminating evidence against Zucker and Gollust. 'First Andrew Cuomo then Chris Cuomo and now this... that is a remarkable domino effect,' he said. DailyMail.com's sources say Cuomo's lawyers are now demanding that CNN preserves all of the communications between Zucker, Gollust and Andrew Cuomo. Sources say that besides the emails and other communications that would reveal the long-term intimacy between Zucker and Gollust they would also reveal how Zucker pressured Andrew Cuomo to appear on CNN and how he pushed his personal agenda on Donald Trump and other conservatives with 'potent negative story lines.' Camerota and Stelter wereblasted by critics who harkened back to when she called FOX News 'rotten to the core', in reference to multiple sexual misconduct scandals that involved non-consensual relationships between senior male staff and junior women. Some slammed her for defending the romance and claimed she - and other CNN reporters - would have immediately criticized it if it had happened at a different network. 'According to Alisyn Camerota, rules shouldn't apply to Jeff Zucker. Just because he's the big boss and your buddy doesn't absolve him. 'This isn't a matter of consent,' said one viewer. 'Alisyn has no problem with the SEXCAPADES at CNN What a hypocrite!!!' fumed another. Politicocites two unnamed sources who say Chris Cuomo's legal team is who brought it the romance to the surface in negotiations for the ousted host's severance pay. Now, DailyMail.com can confirm that CNN has also received a letter from Chris Cuomo's lawyers demanding that all communications between Zucker, Gollust and Andrew Cuomo be preserved. This was first posted in a tweet by Matthew Belloni. Source says that besides the emails and other communications that would reveal the long-term intimacy between Zucker and Gollust they would also reveal how Zucker pressured Andrew Cuomo to appear on CNN and how he pushed his personal agenda on Donald Trump and other conservatives with 'potent negative story lines.' Chris was fired in December last year after an internal investigation found he had helped his brother Andrew, former Governor of New York, navigate through a sexual misconduct scandal, while still working as a CNN host. He is still fighting for $18million - the remainder of his contract - but Zucker has refused to pay out, citing the conflict of interest between Chris's relationship with his brother and his on-air reporting for CNN. According to Politico's sources, Cuomo's team said it was hypocritical for Zucker to fire Chris for a conflict of interest when he has one of his own in his relationship with Gollust. Gollust, who worked as Andrew Cuomo's communications director briefly, is also divorced, though it is unclear when she and her husband Billy - who runs a trading platform - split. Billy has not commented.  One source told DailyMail.com on Wednesday that the affair between Zucker and Gollust was an open secret for years. 'Jeff's affair with Allison has been going on forever – not since COVID! 'Everyone has known it but he still denied it. It was part of the reason for his divorce, but not the only reason. 'It was inevitable that it would come out – he should have been up front sooner.' Another said: 'It was the worst kept secret inside the building. One of the CNN executives stepping up to replace outgoing boss Jeff Zucker is his old Harvard friend and 'longtime loyalist' with an uncannily similar career trajectory. Michael Bass - among three people named interim network leaders Wednesday - is, like Zucker, an ivy league alumni with vast experience at competing networks including NBC, where Zucker once served as the company's chief executive. Until a permanent replacement is named, Bass will lead the network alongside veteran executives Amy Entelis and Ken Jautz. Bass, a married father of three, took over as interim executive producer of the Today show in 2000 after Zucker was named NBC Entertainment's president. When Zucker was promoted to the company's top boss in 2007, Bass's career path kept pace as he became NBC's vice president of strategic initiatives. Zucker also tapped Bass to serve as co-executive producer of Katie Couric's eponymous talk show in 2012. In an yet another similarity, both graduated from Harvard in the mid-1980s and Bass followed Zucker to CNN. Katie Couric, who has worked with both men, described their different management styles in her explosive tell-all 'Going There'. 'Jeff Zucker's feet may only have been size 9, but he left huge shoes to fill when he became president of NBC Entertainment,' she wrote. 'He'd handpicked his friend Michael Bass, a fellow Harvard guy and longtime loyalist, to step in as acting EP at Today. 'Michael was an incredibly nice and a solid producer but lacked Jeff's shrewdness and pizzazz (yeoman-like was a word that got used), which showed in the broadcast. Suddenly it felt like slow, boring, blah.' Bass most recently served as CNN's executive vice president of programming. 'Jeff's office was right next to Allison's office at Hudson Yards and before that at the Time Warner Center on Columbus Circle. 'The joke was they weren't only sharing a wall. No one believes that this only happened over pandemic. They have been close for years. 'The closest it ever came to being outed was when Page Sixreported on their 'heavy exchange' at the Hollywood Reporter's 35 Most Powerful People in NY Media party. 'They had a very public fight at the party that didn't seem to have anything to do with work.' Gollust, who worked as Andrew Cuomo's communications director briefly, is also divorced, though it is unclear when she and her husband Billy - who runs a trading platform - split. Billy has not commented.  Zucker admits lying about when the romance began during the investigation into whether or not Chris Cuomo, formerly the network's most successful host, helped his brother, former New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, through his sexual harassment scandal. 'I acknowledged the relationship evolved in recent years. I was required to disclose it when it began but I didn't. I was wrong. One of the CNNexecutives stepping up to replace outgoing boss Jeff Zucker is his old Harvard friend, Michael Bass, and 'longtime loyalist' with an uncannily similar career trajectory. Until a permanent replacement is named, Bass will lead the network alongside veteran executives Amy Entelis and Ken Jautz. But sources say Bass - who Zucker promoted to replace himself as Executive Producer on the Today show -is one of Zucker's right-hand men and shouldn't be considered for the job. 'The appointment of Michael Bass to the top job – even on an interim basis is outrageous. 'Michael and Jeff are very close friends. Both went to Harvard and both have looked after each other throughout their careers. 'It's such a boys club and an absolute joke.' Zucker is widely concerned one of the most powerful men in media. He has made a long list of enemies throughout his career - most notably Donald Trump, who celebrated his resignation. Zucker's resignation is effective immediately but Gollust will stay on at the network asan Executive Vice President of PR at CNN, and will be staying on in her role despite Zucker's departure. Chris Cuomo has been at war with CNN since he was fired in early December. The network fired him after an investigation by the New York Attorney General's Office revealed the deep extent to which he'd helped his brother Andrew navigate a sexual misconduct scandal. Chris ignored the subject on his nightly CNN talk show, but used his journalistic sources to research some of the women making claims against his brother, according to the AG report. CNN also received a claim that he had been sexually inappropriate with a staff member in the days before he was fired. Chris Cuomo vehemently denied that claim. Gollust, who said she will remain at the network, confirmed the affair in a statement Wednesday released to the New York Times. Chris Cuomo refused to leave CNN quietly after being fired for helping quash sex assault allegations against his brother, disgraced ex-New York Governor Andrew Cuomo - and he was 'trying to burn the place down' when he ousted Jeff Zucker's secret relationship with a senior network executive. Cuomo has always maintained that Zucker knew the extent to which he had helped his brother while he was in office, and the network boss ignored calls to fire him for months. The final straw came after New York AG Letitia James' office released damning evidence where text messages proved he was more deeply involved than he'd let on. Although he was suspended, he was ultimately fired when a lawyer told CNN he was being investigated for sexually harassing a co-worker years earlier at a different network. But, according to CNN's own chief media correspondent Brian Stelter, Cuomo refused to go quietly because his $18 million exit package was on the line. Cuomo's legal team ultimately told CNN investigators that it washypocritical to suggest that the host had a personal conflict of interest while Zucker had failed to disclose his own relationship with comms chief Allison Gollust - even though it was an 'open secret' at the company. Sources told Politco: 'Cuomo's legal team asserted that Zucker was hypocritical to suggest Cuomo had a personal conflict of interest when the relationship with Gollust represented a potential conflict as well,' the outlet reported. On Wednesday, Stelter said that sources told him that Cuomo was 'trying to burn the place down' and had claimed that he had 'incriminating evidence about Zucker and Gollust.' 'If that's the case, this is a domino effect, that begins with Andrew Cuomo going down in the governor's office, and then Chris Cuomo gets fired from CNN, and then Jeff Zucker losing his job.' In December, a spokesman for Cuomo accused Zucker of knowing everything about his involvement in trying to help his brother while he navigated a sexual harassment scandal. 'They were widely known to be extremely close and in regular contact, including about the details of Mr. Cuomo's support for his brother,' the spokesman told the Wall Street Journal. 'There were no secrets about this, as other individuals besides Mr. Cuomo can attest.' CNN then hit back, saying: 'He has made a number of accusations that are patently false. This reinforces why he was terminated for violating our standards and practices, as well as his lack of candor.' And while Cuomo was placed on leave after evidence from James' office proved just how involved he was in trying to quash his allegations against his brother, he was ultimately fired days later when a lawyer contacted the network with a sexual harassment allegation stemming from his previous job at ABC. Employment lawyer Debra S. Katz said the allegation against him was made by a former junior colleague at another network, and was unrelated to his brother, former New York governor Andrew Cuomo. Further details about the allegation were unclear. Cuomo's spokesman denied the claim, saying: 'These apparently anonymous allegations are not true.' CNN's statement announcing Cuomo's termination cited only his 'conduct with his brother's defense' in its decision to terminate the anchor. The popular host's downfall came when documents revealed how heexchanged dozens of text messages with his brother Andrew's top aide, Melissa DeRosa. Cuomo told investigators under oath that they only had 'irregular contact'. But the unearthed texts detailed Cuomo's true role in his brother's public relations crisis as he told senior members of the governor's team, 'we are making mistakes we cant afford.' In one text, on March 3, he also asked DeRosa to 'please let me help with prep'. Cuomo - who earned $6 million annually at CNN, according to Celebrity Net Worth-told investigators that he reached out to a 'non-journalistic' source while fishing for information on one of his brother's accusers. Though he admitted to researching forthcoming accusers, he vehemently denied to investigators setting out to discredit them. 'I would never do oppo research on anybody alleging anything like this,' he told investigators.'I'm not in the oppo research business. I don't tolerate a lot of oppo research on any level.' When asked to define 'oppo research', he said: 'the idea of trying to find ways to disparage people who come forward with allegations like this is not what I'm about.' Cuomo's text exchanges contradict his claims to investigators that he had 'irregular contact' with DeRosa. His testimony was subject to the penalty of perjury. He on March 12 sent her a text, dictating how the governor should respond to calls for his resignation. 'READ THIS,' Cuomo said. 'I will not resign. I cannot resign. I am in a different position and I am working with a different standard than these other politicians I understand why they have to say what they are saying. 'I understand the political pressure I understand the stakes of political warfare, and that's what this is… And I understand the conformity that can be forced by cancel culture.' Discussions centered around Andrew Cuomo stepping down prompted the governor to consider doing so in March, Cuomo said. 'I told him, 'If you have done nothing that you believe was wrong, don't resign,' Cuomo told investigators. 'Because resigning is you saying that you did something wrong. Don't do it.' 'Jeff and I have been close friends and professional partners for over 20 years,' she wrote. 'Recently, our relationship changed during COVID. I regret that we didn't disclose it at the right time. 1986: Zucker hired as an Olympics researcher for NBC 1989: Zucker starts working as producer on Today 1996: Zucker marries his NBC colleague Caryn 2000: Zucker promoted to president of entertainment at NBC after boosting ratings on Today He meets Gollust at NBC. 2003: Zucker promoted to head of news, cable and entertainment at NBC 2005: Zucker becomes head of NBC Universal, new umbrella brand 2007: Zucker becomes President and CEO of NBC Universal 2010: Zucker leaves NBC, taking a package of between $30m-$40m dollars 2011: Zucker joins Katie Couric as producer on her ABC show 2012: Zucker joins CNN 2018: Zucker and his wife Caryn split 2021: Zucker announces plans to leave the company at the end of the year. He then said he would stay on until TimeWarner's deal with Discovery was complete 'I'm incredibly proud of my time at CNN and look forward to continuing the great work we do everyday.' The couple was spotted together at a Billy Joel concert last November, where they were called out for defying mask regulations, but their romance was not picked up on. In 2017, Zucker and Gollust were seen in a heated argument at the Hollywood Reporter's 35 Most Powerful People in NY Media party. A source explained at the time that while the party was taking place, Zucker and Gollust suddenly started intensely speaking and making anguished hand gestures before Gollust stormed away into the crowd. 'It looked like she was reprimanding her husband or something,' mocked an unnamed rival news executive at the time. Other journalists have pointed to the romance too. In her book, Katie Couric told of how Zucker tried to push Gollust onto Couric's show, despite the fact there was no role for her. 'I had to wonder why Jeff was angling so hard to bring Allison on board. 'She and her husband and kids had moved into the apartment right above Jeff and Caryn's—everyone who heard about their cozy arrangement thought it was super strange. 'By that point, Caryn (Zucker's ex-wife) had become a close friend and it made me really uncomfortable,' Katie wrote in her memoir. Zucker made a long-list of enemies over the years at CNN, most notable of whom is Donald Trump. Trump celebrated his resignation on Wednesday, saying in an emailed statement: 'Jeff Zucker, a world-class sleazebag who has headed ratings and real-news-challenged CNN for far too long, has been terminated for numerous reasons, but predominantly because CNN has lost its way with viewers and everybody else. 'Now is a chance to put Fake News in the backseat because there may not be anything more important than straightening out the horrendous LameStream Media in our Country, and in the case of CNN, throughout the World. 'Jeff Zucker is gone—congratulations to all!' he said. Megyn Kelly, former FOX News host, tweeted: 'Zucker's relationship with Gollust went on for years, and what he did to keep her near him (as he kept advancing her up the line) will be even more stunning to the CNN news room.'"
30,Chris isn't done yet! Cuomo's lawyers demand to see emails they believe will prove Jeff Zucker KNEW about his help for brother Andrew that could cost the former CNN chief millions of dollars after sacked host forced him to resign ,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10468905/CNN-president-Jeff-Zucker-quits-amid-Chris-Cuomo-fallout-admits-having-affair-with.html,"Lawyers for ousted CNN anchor Chris Cuomo wrote to the network demanding that all communications between network chief Jeff Zucker, his staffer-lover Allison Gollust, and Chris's brother Andrew - the former governor of New York - be preserved, DailyMail.com can confirm. Chris's lawyers sought the preservation of the communications as proof both that Zucker had a conflict of interest, while he was accusing Chris of his own conflict of interest in helping his brother. Zucker resigned from his $6 million-a-year job at the network on Wednesday, forced out by the revelations from Chris's legal team of a conflict of interest. Gollust worked as Andrew Cuomo's PR director before joining CNN, adding to the cozy familiarity among the group. Zucker was highly prized by the network, and his contract was due to expire on December 31, 2021, but was extended to see him carry on working through the merger with Discovery. If his contract contained a severance clause, that payout could now be in jeopardy because his undisclosed relationship with a fellow employee violates company policy. Zucker's refusal to pay out the remained of Chris Cuomo's contract, worth an estimated $18 million, is key to his own downfall. Zucker has argued that his fallen star anchor cannot claim the payout because his conduct - in advising his brother - brought the network into disrepute. That same argument, of violating company policy, could now see Zucker miss out on his own payout, which would likely be worth many millions. A source says that besides the emails and other communications that would reveal the long term intimacy between Zucker and Gollust, they would also reveal how Zucker pressured Andrew Cuomo to appear on CNN and how he pushed his personal agenda about Donald Trump and other conservatives with 'potent negative story lines.' Chris Cuomo blewthe whistle on Zucker's years-long, open-secret affair with Gollust while fighting for his $18million severance pay, according unnamed media sources. In a statement on Wednesday, Zucker said he was stepping down for failing to disclose his relationship with Gollust when he was being interviewed as part of the investigation into Chris Cuomo. He and Gollust claim the romance started during COVID, but media sources tell DailyMail.com it long predates the pandemic and was an open-secret in the CNN offices. They lived in the same apartment building with their respective families, have worked together at NBC and then at CNN for more than 20 years, and had what some called an 'uncomfortably cozy' rapport. They are both now divorced, and one source told DailyMail.com that their splits were due in part to their affair. Politico cites two unnamed sources who say Chris Cuomo's legal team brought the romance to the surface during negotiations for the ousted host's severance pay.

Inside Jeff Zucker and Allison Gollust's 'cozy' relationship: As 'open-secret affair' sparks CNN boss's exit, how duo became 'joined at the hip' 20 years ago and even lived one floor apart in SAME New York apartment building From Jeff helping Allison, 49, land her current job at CNN to living in the same apartment building with their respective families, the two have, according to former colleague Katie Couric, been 'joined at the hip' for more than two decades. Where it all began, as colleagues at NBC Harvard graduate Jeff and Allison - who began her career as a news anchor, reporter, and producer in Denver, Colorado - first met when they both worked at NBC. According to her CNN profile, Allison started working for the company in 1996, six years after Jeff earned his first role within the network, and one year later, she was named as the senior publicist for the Today show. Allison then served as the executive vice president of corporate communications for NBC, where she oversaw all aspects of the company's global communications efforts. As for Jeff, who graduated from Harvard University in 1986, he started as a field producer for the Today show, where he rose through the ranks, eventually earning the job as executive producer on the show, before being named as the president of NBC Entertainment in 2000. In her book, Going There, former NBC host Couric recalled her first encounter with Jeff, who was at the time a budding writer-producer, in 1990, describing him as being a 'nerd' who was 'seemed a little cocky, especially for someone so young'. Then, on February 6, 2007, Jeff became president and CEO of NBC Universal. Despite gaining a lot of power at NBC, Jeff was shoved out of the company in 2010, after its merger with Comcast Corporation. The Los Angeles Times reported at the time that Comcast Chief Operating Officer Steve Burke 'told Jeff that he wanted him to 'move on' as soon as Comcast took control of the media conglomerate.' During his time at NBC, Jeff had several misfires - most notably, when he brought in independent producer Ben Silverman, which ultimately caused NBC's ratings to plummet. He was also slammed for moving Jay Leno's show to prime time, which negatively impacted the number of viewers. Looking out for one another: How Jeff tried to snag Allison a job alongside him on Katie Couric's show Both of them left NBC within months of one another in 2010, and Jeff spent several months without a job, before reuniting with former colleague Couric in 2011 in order to produce her self-titled daytime talkshow. However, even after they both departed NBC, Jeff and Allison remained incredibly close. So close, in fact, that Jeff fought hard to get Allison a job on Katie's show while he was there. The talk show host claimed in her 2021 memoir, Going There, that Jeff made a 'huge push' to bring Allison onto their staff, but they unfortunately didn't have a role for her. 'They were joined at the hip. The problem was, we'd already hired a PR person for the show. There really wasn't a role for Allison,' she wrote.'I had to wonder why Jeff was angling so hard to bring Allison on board.' In late 2012, rumors started to circulate that Jeff was planning to leave Katie's show to join CNN, andKatie later claimed that he and Allison had teamed up to plant those stories - writing that 'everyone knew he and Allison had Page Six on speed dial.' Jeff then became the president of CNN onJanuary 1, 2013. Reuniting at CNN: How Jeff brought Allison on-board as his first hire After leaving NBC, Allison took a job as then-New York Governor Andrew Cuomo's communications director at the end of 2012. However, just four months later, it was revealed that she had quit the role and was moving to CNN. '[Jeff's] first hire?' Katie wrote in her book. 'Allison Gollust.' She was hired at the company as senior vice president of communications. 'Allison is among the most experienced and respected communications executives in the media industry, and her close working relationship with Jeff Zucker is one of its most successful professional partnerships,' Jeff Matteson, senior vice president of communications for Turner Broadcasting System, Inc., said at the time. Jeff added in a statement: 'In the 15 years that Allison and I have worked together, I've depended on her judgment, counsel and relationships. 'Allison is joining CNN at an exciting time, and she and the strong communications team she's inheriting will play a critical role in shaping the organization and its story going forward. It's great to have her at CNN.' Living in close quarters: Pair spark speculation after moving into the same apartment building just one floor apart Jeff and Allison lived in the same apartment building on the Upper East Side with their respective families until Jeff sold his in 2020, after he and his ex-wife - supervisor of Saturday Night Life Caryn Stephanie Nathanson - split. The building is located at on the corner of Madison Avenue in Manhattan, New York. He resided in apartment 3W, while Allison lived in the unit right above him - number 4W - which she still owns. Katie later claimed that their 'cozy arrangement' was 'super strange' and made her 'really uncomfortable.' She said in her book: '[Allison] and her husband and kids had moved into the apartment right above Jeff and [his wife] Caryn's - everyone who heard about their cozy arrangement thought it was super strange. 'By that point, Caryn had become a close friend and it made me really uncomfortable.' Allison's apartment has two bedrooms and two and a half bathrooms, while Jeff's contained five bedrooms and four and a half bathrooms. He sold it for $15.4 million. Both of them also own Hampton houses within 20 minutes from one another. According to public sales records, Jeff's home hasn't been put up for sale since he purchased it in 1999 - however it's not known whether he or his wife took ownership of it in the divorce. Records also show that Allison still owners her Hampton home. Leaving their respective partners: Lengthy marriages both end in divorce Jeff and his ex-wife split in 2018 after 21 years of marriage, due to reportedly 'growing apart.' A source toldPage Six at the time: 'It can't be easy being married to Jeff - he is a workaholic, and is obsessed with news, and obsessed with being the best. 'Caryn is much more laid back and social, spends a lot of time with their kids and enjoys being part of the Upper East Side social circuit. 'They've had their problems over the years. Things have been bad for 10 years, but they have now accepted their marriage is over, and he has moved out of their apartment.' The former couple share four kids together - three daughters and a son. As for Allison, she was previously married to Billy Hult,the president of online marketplace platform Tradeweb. According to RadarOnline, they broke up 12 months after Jeff and Caryn finalized their divorced. Before they split, they welcomed two daughters together namedOlivia and Ava. Now, sources have claimed that both of their marriages ended because of their budding romance. An insider told DailyMail.com on Wednesday: 'It was part of the reason for his divorce, but not the only reason. It was inevitable that it would come out – he should have been up front sooner.' Going public with their romance: Couple claim their 'relationship changed during COVID' According to Allison, who said she will remain at the network, however, it wasn't until the COVID-19 pandemic hit that things turned romantic between them. 'Jeff and I have been close friends and professional partners for over 20 years,' she wrote. 'Recently, our relationship changed during COVID,' she said in a statement released to the New York Times. 'I regret that we didn't disclose it at the right time. I'm incredibly proud of my time at CNN and look forward to continuing the great work we do everyday.' In a memo to CNN staff on Wednesday, Jeff spoke out about it too. He said: 'As part of the investigation into Chris Cuomo's tenure at CNN, I was asked about a consensual relationship with my closest colleague, someone I have worked with for more than 20 years. 'I acknowledged the relationship evolved in recent years. I was required to disclose it when it began but I didn't. I was wrong.'  "
31,CNN staff accuse Allison Gollust of lying about only starting a relationship with Jeff Zucker recently: Soledad O'Brien suggests it began more than EIGHT years ago ,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10470459/CNN-staff-accuse-Allison-Gollust-lying-starting-relationship-Jeff-Zucker-recently.html,"The lover of CNN president Jeff Zucker was accused of lying on Wednesday about her relationship with the network chief, claiming that the romance which ended his career only blossomed during the pandemic. Zucker, 56, resigned on Wednesday from his $6 million-a-year role after his relationship with fellow employee Allison Gollust, 49, was revealed. The company has a rule mandating the disclosure of personal relationships between bosses and their staff, and Zucker was 'outed' by former anchor Chris Cuomo, who is trying to get an $18 million payout from the network. Zucker has been refusing, insisting that Cuomo's assistance of his brother Andrew Cuomo, the former governor of New York, during his sex scandal brought the company into disrepute, and voided any potential payout. Cuomo's lawyers pointed out that Zucker was himself violating company policy in his relationship with Gollust. Gollust confirmed the relationship, but raised eyebrows by claiming it only begun during the pandemic. 'Jeff and I have been close friends and professional partners for over 20 years,' she wrote. 'Recently, our relationship changed during COVID. I regret that we didn't disclose it at the right time.' Soledad O'Brien, a former CNN anchor, tweeted: 'I encourage you to google the two parties and read the details about their relationship that dates back years. 'That said, I'm sure company emails can easily determine if she's lying in this statement. 'Again—It was an open secret and I haven't even worked there for like 8 years.' She added: 'I find the 'it started during Covid' claim pretty amusing.' 1986: Zucker hired as an Olympics researcher for NBC 1989: Zucker starts working as producer on Today 1996: Zucker marries his NBC colleague Caryn 2000: Zucker promoted to president of entertainment at NBC after boosting ratings on Today He meets Gollust at NBC. 2003: Zucker promoted to head of news, cable and entertainment at NBC 2005: Zucker becomes head of NBC Universal, new umbrella brand 2007: Zucker becomes President and CEO of NBC Universal 2010: Zucker leaves NBC, taking a package of between $30m-$40m dollars 2011: Zucker joins Katie Couric as producer on her ABC show 2012: Zucker joins CNN 2018: Zucker and his wife Caryn split 2021: Zucker announces plans to leave the company at the end of the year. He then said he would stay on until TimeWarner's deal with Discovery was complete Anotherinsider told The New York Postthat Gollust's timeline was 'a total lie.' 'They've been together for years,' the source said. 'And she's still lying about it today — the statement she made that 'recently our relationship changed during COVID' is a total lie.' Another source told the paper that Gollust and Zucker had been together 'for years', and said women at the network were angry that she was allowed to keep her job. 'Why is she allowed to keep her job?' a CNN said. 'CNN is supposed to be a transparent news network. 'How does she get away with lying about their affair for so long?' Zucker split from his wife of 21 years, Caryn, in 2018. Gollust filed from divorce from her husband Billy Hult, the president of Tradeweb Markets, an international financial services firm, in 2015. The case was settled in 2017, according to court records. The two share two children together. Zucker and Gollust were spotted together at a Billy Joel concert last November, where they were called out for defying mask regulations, but their romance was not picked up on. In 2017, Zucker and Gollust were seen in a heated argument at the Hollywood Reporter's 35 Most Powerful People in NY Media party. A source explained at the time that while the party was taking place, Zucker and Gollust suddenly started intensely speaking and making anguished hand gestures before Gollust stormed away into the crowd. 'It looked like she was reprimanding her husband or something,' mocked an unnamed rival news executive at the time. Other journalists have pointed to the romance too. In her book, Katie Couric told of how Zucker tried to push Gollust onto Couric's show, despite the fact there was no role for her. 'I had to wonder why Jeff was angling so hard to bring Allison on board. 'She and her husband and kids had moved into the apartment right above Jeff and Caryn's—everyone who heard about their cozy arrangement thought it was super strange. 'By that point, Caryn (Zucker's ex-wife) had become a close friend and it made me really uncomfortable,' Katie wrote in her memoir. Zucker made a long-list of enemies over the years at CNN, most notable of whom is Donald Trump. Trump celebrated his resignation on Wednesday, saying in an emailed statement: 'Jeff Zucker, a world-class sleazebag who has headed ratings and real-news-challenged CNN for far too long, has been terminated for numerous reasons, but predominantly because CNN has lost its way with viewers and everybody else. 'Now is a chance to put Fake News in the backseat because there may not be anything more important than straightening out the horrendous LameStream Media in our Country, and in the case of CNN, throughout the World. 'Jeff Zucker is gone—congratulations to all!' he said. Megyn Kelly, former FOX News host, tweeted: 'Zucker's relationship with Gollust went on for years, and what he did to keep her near him (as he kept advancing her up the line) will be even more stunning to the CNN news room.' Chris Cuomo refused to leave CNN quietly after being fired for helping quash sex assault allegations against his brother, disgraced ex-New York Governor Andrew Cuomo - and he was 'trying to burn the place down' when he ousted Jeff Zucker's secret relationship with a senior network executive. Cuomo has always maintained that Zucker knew the extent to which he had helped his brother while he was in office, and the network boss ignored calls to fire him for months. The final straw came after New York AG Letitia James' office released damning evidence where text messages proved he was more deeply involved than he'd let on. Although he was suspended, he was ultimately fired when a lawyer told CNN he was being investigated for sexually harassing a co-worker years earlier at a different network. But, according to CNN's own chief media correspondent Brian Stelter, Cuomo refused to go quietly because his $18 million exit package was on the line. Cuomo's legal team ultimately told CNN investigators that it washypocritical to suggest that the host had a personal conflict of interest while Zucker had failed to disclose his own relationship with comms chief Allison Gollust - even though it was an 'open secret' at the company. Sources told Politco: 'Cuomo's legal team asserted that Zucker was hypocritical to suggest Cuomo had a personal conflict of interest when the relationship with Gollust represented a potential conflict as well,' the outlet reported. On Wednesday, Stelter said that sources told him that Cuomo was 'trying to burn the place down' and had claimed that he had 'incriminating evidence about Zucker and Gollust.' 'If that's the case, this is a domino effect, that begins with Andrew Cuomo going down in the governor's office, and then Chris Cuomo gets fired from CNN, and then Jeff Zucker losing his job.' In December, a spokesman for Cuomo accused Zucker of knowing everything about his involvement in trying to help his brother while he navigated a sexual harassment scandal. 'They were widely known to be extremely close and in regular contact, including about the details of Mr. Cuomo's support for his brother,' the spokesman told the Wall Street Journal. 'There were no secrets about this, as other individuals besides Mr. Cuomo can attest.' CNN then hit back, saying: 'He has made a number of accusations that are patently false. This reinforces why he was terminated for violating our standards and practices, as well as his lack of candor.' And while Cuomo was placed on leave after evidence from James' office proved just how involved he was in trying to quash his allegations against his brother, he was ultimately fired days later when a lawyer contacted the network with a sexual harassment allegation stemming from his previous job at ABC. Employment lawyer Debra S. Katz said the allegation against him was made by a former junior colleague at another network, and was unrelated to his brother, former New York governor Andrew Cuomo. Further details about the allegation were unclear. Cuomo's spokesman denied the claim, saying: 'These apparently anonymous allegations are not true.' CNN's statement announcing Cuomo's termination cited only his 'conduct with his brother's defense' in its decision to terminate the anchor. The popular host's downfall came when documents revealed how heexchanged dozens of text messages with his brother Andrew's top aide, Melissa DeRosa. Cuomo told investigators under oath that they only had 'irregular contact'. But the unearthed texts detailed Cuomo's true role in his brother's public relations crisis as he told senior members of the governor's team, 'we are making mistakes we cant afford.' In one text, on March 3, he also asked DeRosa to 'please let me help with prep'. Cuomo - who earned $6 million annually at CNN, according to Celebrity Net Worth-told investigators that he reached out to a 'non-journalistic' source while fishing for information on one of his brother's accusers. Though he admitted to researching forthcoming accusers, he vehemently denied to investigators setting out to discredit them. 'I would never do oppo research on anybody alleging anything like this,' he told investigators.'I'm not in the oppo research business. I don't tolerate a lot of oppo research on any level.' When asked to define 'oppo research', he said: 'the idea of trying to find ways to disparage people who come forward with allegations like this is not what I'm about.' Cuomo's text exchanges contradict his claims to investigators that he had 'irregular contact' with DeRosa. His testimony was subject to the penalty of perjury. He on March 12 sent her a text, dictating how the governor should respond to calls for his resignation. 'READ THIS,' Cuomo said. 'I will not resign. I cannot resign. I am in a different position and I am working with a different standard than these other politicians I understand why they have to say what they are saying. 'I understand the political pressure I understand the stakes of political warfare, and that's what this is… And I understand the conformity that can be forced by cancel culture.' Discussions centered around Andrew Cuomo stepping down prompted the governor to consider doing so in March, Cuomo said. 'I told him, 'If you have done nothing that you believe was wrong, don't resign,' Cuomo told investigators. 'Because resigning is you saying that you did something wrong. Don't do it.' Inside Jeff Zucker and Allison Gollust's 'cozy' relationship: As 'open-secret affair' sparks CNN boss's exit, how duo became 'joined at the hip' 20 years ago and even lived one floor apart in SAME New York apartment building From Jeff helping Allison, 49, land her current job at CNN to living in the same apartment building with their respective families, the two have, according to former colleague Katie Couric, been 'joined at the hip' for more than two decades. Where it all began, as colleagues at NBC Harvard graduate Jeff and Allison - who began her career as a news anchor, reporter, and producer in Denver, Colorado - first met when they both worked at NBC. According to her CNN profile, Allison started working for the company in 1996, six years after Jeff earned his first role within the network, and one year later, she was named as the senior publicist for the Today show. Allison then served as the executive vice president of corporate communications for NBC, where she oversaw all aspects of the company's global communications efforts. As for Jeff, who graduated from Harvard University in 1986, he started as a field producer for the Today show, where he rose through the ranks, eventually earning the job as executive producer on the show, before being named as the president of NBC Entertainment in 2000. In her book, Going There, former NBC host Couric recalled her first encounter with Jeff, who was at the time a budding writer-producer, in 1990, describing him as being a 'nerd' who was 'seemed a little cocky, especially for someone so young'. Then, on February 6, 2007, Jeff became president and CEO of NBC Universal. Despite gaining a lot of power at NBC, Jeff was shoved out of the company in 2010, after its merger with Comcast Corporation. The Los Angeles Times reported at the time that Comcast Chief Operating Officer Steve Burke 'told Jeff that he wanted him to 'move on' as soon as Comcast took control of the media conglomerate.' During his time at NBC, Jeff had several misfires - most notably, when he brought in independent producer Ben Silverman, which ultimately caused NBC's ratings to plummet. He was also slammed for moving Jay Leno's show to prime time, which negatively impacted the number of viewers. Looking out for one another: How Jeff tried to snag Allison a job alongside him on Katie Couric's show Both of them left NBC within months of one another in 2010, and Jeff spent several months without a job, before reuniting with former colleague Couric in 2011 in order to produce her self-titled daytime talkshow.

In late 2012, rumors started to circulate that Jeff was planning to leave Katie's show to join CNN, andKatie later claimed that he and Allison had teamed up to plant those stories - writing that 'everyone knew he and Allison had Page Six on speed dial.' Jeff then became the president of CNN onJanuary 1, 2013. Reuniting at CNN: How Jeff brought Allison on-board as his first hire After leaving NBC, Allison took a job as then-New York Governor Andrew Cuomo's communications director at the end of 2012.

32,'Brian Stelter should start looking for another job.' Attention turns to the CNN anchor following Jeff Zucker's ousting for his failure to report on the open secret affair while bashing other news networks,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10469837/Insiders-calling-CNN-anchor-Brian-Stelter-FIRED.html,"Media critics are calling for Brian Stelter to be fired after failing to report the 'open secret' affair between top boss Jeff Zucker and staffer Allison Gollust. 'The network needs to step up and fire Brian Stelter,' a CNN insider tells DailyMail.com. 'He is allegedly our top media reporter - yet he failed to report on the scoop that everyone in the office knew. And if he wants to say he didn't know, he is truly terrible at his job.' Stelter is the chief media correspondent for CNN and host of the CNN program Reliable Sources. In a statement on Wednesday, Zucker said he was stepping down as CNN president for failing to disclose his relationship with Gollust when he was being interviewed as part of the investigation into Chris Cuomo. He and Gollust claim the romance started during COVID, but media sources tell DailyMail.com it long predates the pandemic and was an open-secret in the CNN offices. A cable news veteran, who wishes not to be named, spoke of the close relationship between Stelter and Zucker. 'Brian Stelter should be calling his agent to start looking for another job,' they said. 'He's been Jeff Zucker's water boy for years and no one believes he didn't know about all of this.' The source added that Stelter often criticizes competing networks, like Fox News. 'He's been sitting on his moral high horse doing Jeff's bidding and ripping Fox and every other media outlet that Jeff tells him to while his ratings crash and burn. Where was he on the biggest story at his own network after chastising everyone else?' Since taking the helm in 2013, CNN has reportedly not seen any ratings improvement – losing audience share, independent viewers and ratings throughout Zucker’s tenure. CNN is delivering the largest declines in cable news this month – down roughly 80% in primetime and total day across the board. DailyMail.com has reached out to Stelter for comment. One source tells us 'everyone knew' about the affair and it had been an 'open secret for years'. It became so much of an issue that Warner Media separated Zucker and Gollust last year, the source claimed. 'That wasn't enough of a hint this was going on in plain sight?,' they added. Gollust and Zuckerlived in the same apartment building with their respective families, have worked together at NBC and then CNN for more than 20 years, and had what some called an 'uncomfortably cozy' rapport. 'Jeff took Allison to every job he had - after they left NBC, he tried to get her on Katie Couric's show which failed, then he placed her at his friend Governor Cuomo's office, then took her to CNN as soon as he was he got that job all while failing upward along the way,' they said. They are both now divorced, and one source told DailyMail.com that their splits were due in part to their relationship. Politicocites two unnamed sources who say Chris Cuomo's legal team is who brought the romance to the surface in negotiations for the ousted host's $18million severance pay. Chris was fired in December last year after an internal investigation found he had helped his brother Andrew, former Governor of New York, navigate through a sexual misconduct scandal, while still working as a CNN host. He is still fighting for $18million - the remainder of his contract - but Zucker has refused to pay out, citing the conflict of interest between Chris's relationship with his brother and his on-air reporting for CNN. According to Politico's sources, Cuomo's team said it was hypocritical for Zucker to fire Chris for a conflict of interest when he has one of his own in his relationship with Gollust. 'Jeff’s affair with Allison has been going on forever – not since COVID!' one source told DailyMail.com. 'Everyone has known it but he still denied it. It was part of the reason for his divorce, but not the only reason. 'It was inevitable that it would come out – he should have been up front sooner.' Another said: 'It was the worst kept secret inside the building. 'Jeff’s office was right next to Allison’s office at Hudson Yards and before that at the Time Warner Center on Columbus Circle. 'The joke was they weren’t only sharing a wall. No one believes that this only happened over pandemic. They have been close for years. 'The closest it ever came to being outed was when Page Sixreported on their “heavy exchange” at the Hollywood Reporter’s 35 Most Powerful People in NY Media party. 'They had a very public fight at the party that didn’t seem to have anything to do with work.' Zucker admits lying about when the romance began during the investigation into whether or not Chris Cuomo, formerly the network's most successful host, helped his brother, former New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, through his sexual harassment scandal. 'I acknowledged the relationship evolved in recent years. I was required to disclose it when it began but I didn't. I was wrong. 'As a result, I am resigning today,' he said."
33,"Trump tears into 'world class sleazebag' Jeff Zucker, insists his affair with staffer isn't the only reason he resigned from CNN and calls for a 'straightening out' of the 'horrendous lamestream media' ",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10469177/Trump-tears-world-class-sleazebag-Jeff-Zucker-CNN-exit.html,"Former President Donald Trump tore into 'world-class sleazebag' Jeff Zucker on Wednesday and insisted the CNN boss' relationship with a colleague wasn't the only reason he resigned. 'Jeff Zucker, a world-class sleazebag who has headed ratings and real-news-challenged CNN for far too long, has been terminated for numerous reasons, but predominantly because CNN has lost its way with viewers and everybody else,' the ex-president said in a statement. While in recent years, Zucker and Trump were at odds, when Zucker was the president of NBC Entertainment he greenlit The Apprentice, which turned Trump into a reality television star, giving the real estate developer national name recognition that undoubtedly helped him win the White House in 2016. Trump, who has hammered the mainstream media for being critical of him, suggested Zucker's exit would give CNN an opportunity to reboot. 'Now is a change to put Fake News in the backseat because there may not be anything more important than straightening out the horrendous LameStream Media in our Country, and in the case of CNN, throughout the World,' the ex-president continued. 'Jeff Zucker is gone - congratulations to all!' Trump concluded. Zucker's exit from the network came after he failed to disclose a sexual relationship with a colleague, which was unearthed in the probe over ousted anchor Chris Cuomo's behavior. In a memo to colleagues obtained by The New York Times, Zucker wrote, 'As part of the investigation into Chris Cuomo's tenure at CNN, I was asked about a consensual relationship with my closest colleague, someone I have worked with for more than 20 years.' 'I acknowledged the relationship evolved in recent years. I was required to disclose it when it began but I didn't. I was wrong,' he said. Zucker was datingAllison Gollust, another CNN executive. Trump has long panned CNN for its coverage - with attendees at his rallies often chanting 'CNN sucks' near the press pen. But at the beginning of his 2016 run, Zucker at the helm of CNN helped make Trump. Zucker pushed the network to broadcast Trump rallies even before they started. 'DONALD TRUMP EXPECTED TO SPEAK ANY MINUTE,' the network's chyron would read. At the same time, Zucker and the Trump campaign would be back-channeling, according to recordings from Trump's fixer Michael Cohen and reported on in The New York Times. But as the Trump years went on, the network became more outwardly anti-Trump. The Times' Ben Smith wrote in a September 2020 column that the more anti-Trump version of CNN may have just been 'Mr. Zucker's latest reflexive adaptation in search of ratings.' 'The other is that Mr. Zucker, TV's Dr. Frankenstein, has been willing to dent his network's nonpartisan brand in order to kill his runaway monster, Mr. Trump,' Smith wrote. In recent weeks Trump and his allies have also turned against Fox for not doing enough to prop up the so-called 'big lie.' Fox News Channel is also not covering Trump's rallies live. 'The Fox scam is over! Fox does not cover Trump at all, whatsoever,' complained Trump's former White House strategist Steve Bannon in a podcast taping after Trump's Arizona rally in mid-January. Trump headlined two rallies - one in Arizona and one in Texas - in January. This week the American Conservative Union also confirmed that Trump would return to the Conservative Political Action Conference, which takes place the last weekend of February in Orlando Florida. CPAC was moved to Orlando last year due to Maryland's COVID-19 restrictions against large gatherings. CPAC had been put on at the GaylordNational Resort & Convention Center in the National Harbor development situated alongside the Potomac River, right outside of Washington, D.C."

Michael Bass - among three people named interim network leaders Wednesday - is, like Zucker, an ivy league alumni with vast experience at competing networks including NBC, where Zucker once served as the company's chief executive. Until a permanent replacement is named, Bass will lead the network alongside veteran executives Amy Entelis and Ken Jautz. Bass, a married father of three, took over as interim executive producer of the Today show in 2000 after Zucker was named NBC Entertainment's president. When Zucker was promoted to the company's top boss in 2007, Bass's career path kept pace as he became NBC's vice president of strategic initiatives. Zucker also tapped Bass to serve as co-executive producer of Katie Couric's eponymous talk show in 2012. In an yet another similarity, both graduated from Harvard in the mid-1980s and Bass followed Zucker to CNN. Katie Couric, who has worked with both men, described their different management styles in her explosive tell-all 'Going There'. 'Jeff Zucker's feet may only have been size 9, but he left huge shoes to fill when he became president of NBC Entertainment,' she wrote. 'He'd handpicked his friend Michael Bass, a fellow Harvard guy and longtime loyalist, to step in as acting EP at Today. 'Michael was an incredibly nice and a solid producer but lacked Jeff's shrewdness and pizzazz (yeoman-like was a word that got used), which showed in the broadcast. Suddenly it felt like slow, boring, blah.' Bass most recently served as CNN's executive vice president of programming. Zucker stepped down from the role Wednesday after an investigation into colleague Chris Cuomo's professional misconduct revealed that Zucker had been involved in a secret relationship with longtime colleague Allison Gollust. In Zucker's announcement to staff on Wednesday, he said: 'As part of the investigation into Chris Cuomo's tenure at CNN, I was asked about a consensual relationship with my closest colleague, someone I have worked with for more than 20 years. I acknowledged the relationship evolved in recent years. I was required to disclose it when it began but I didn't. I was wrong.' Last February, anNBC Newsarticle hinted Gollust - CNN's executive vice president and chief marketing officer - would be tapped to lead CNN upon Zucker's retirement. 'As Zucker's most-trusted lieutenant for decades, she has been involved in or had a front-row seat to every major decision of his tenure at the network, from international deals to talent management and programming,' the network reported, citing CNN sources. Until a permanent replacement is named, Bass will lead the network alongside veteran executives Amy Entelis and Ken Jautz. Entelis, CNN's executive vice president for talent and content development, joined the network in 2012 and previously spent 30 years working for ABC News. The Columbia School of Journalism grad has worked as a producer for News World Tonight With Peter Jennings, and was later tapped to lead recruitment efforts for the network's most popular news programs. Jautz, the company's executive vice president, joined the broadcaster as its Germany bureau chief, where he covered the fall of the Berlin Wall, revolutions in East European countries, and the end of the Soviet Union, according to his online bio."
35,"Inside Jeff Zucker and Allison Gollust's 'cozy' relationship: As 'open-secret affair' sparks CNN boss's exit, how duo became 'joined at the hip' 20 years ago and even lived one floor apart in SAME New York apartment building ",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-10469049/Inside-Jeff-Zucker-Allison-Gollust-20-year-long-relationship-secret-affair-comes-light.html,"CNN President Jeff Zucker stepped down on Wednesday after being outed for his years-long secret romance with colleague Allison Gollust, which was brought to light as part of the network's investigation into former anchor Chris Cuomo. Jeff, 56, confirmed that he was resigning after he failed to disclose his relationship with Allison, who is the executive vice president and chief marketing officer for CNN Worldwide. But how did Jeff and Allison's romance blossom? As the secret affair comes to light, FEMAIL has uncovered intimate details on their 20-year long relationship. From Jeff helping Allison, 49, land her current job at CNN to living in the same apartment building with their respective families, the two have, according to former colleague Katie Couric, been 'joined at the hip' for more than two decades. Where it all began, as colleagues at NBC Harvard graduate Jeff and Allison - whobegan her career as a news anchor, reporter, and producer in Denver, Colorado - first met when they both worked at NBC. According to her CNN profile, Allison started working for the company in 1996, six years after Jeff earned his first role within the network, and one year later, she was named as the senior publicist for the Today show. Allison then served as theexecutive vice president of corporate communications for NBC, where she oversaw all aspects of the company's global communications efforts. As for Jeff, who graduated fromHarvard University in 1986, he started as a field producer for the Today show, where he rose through the ranks, eventually earning the job as executive producer on the show, before being named as the president of NBC Entertainment in 2000. In her book, Going There, former NBC host Couric recalled her first encounter with Jeff, who was at the time a budding writer-producer, in 1990, describing him as being a 'nerd' who was 'seemed a little cocky, especially for someone so young'. Then, on February 6, 2007, Jeff became president and CEO of NBC Universal. Despite gaining a lot of power at NBC, Jeff was shoved out of the company in 2010, after its merger with Comcast Corporation. The Los Angeles Times reported at the time thatComcast Chief Operating Officer Steve Burke 'told Jeff that he wanted him to ""move on"" as soon as Comcast took control of the media conglomerate.' During his time at NBC, Jeff had several misfires - most notably, when he brought in independent producer Ben Silverman, which ultimately caused NBC's ratings to plummet. He was also slammed for moving Jay Leno's show to prime time, which negatively impacted the number of viewers. Looking out for one another: How Jeff tried to snag Allison a job alongside him on Katie Couric's show  Both of them left NBC within months of one another in 2010, and Jeff spent several months without a job, before reuniting with former colleague Couric in 2011 in order to produce her self-titled daytime talkshow. However, even after they both departed NBC, Jeff and Allison remained incredibly close. So close, in fact, that Jeff fought hard to get Allison a job on Katie's show while he was there. The talk show host claimed in her 2021 memoir, Going There, that Jeff made a 'huge push' to bring Allison onto their staff, but they unfortunately didn't have a role for her. 'They were joined at the hip. The problem was, we’d already hired a PR person for the show. There really wasn’t a role for Allison,' she wrote.'I had to wonder why Jeff was angling so hard to bring Allison on board.' In late 2012, rumors started to circulate that Jeff was planning to leave Katie's show to join CNN, andKatie later claimed that he and Allison had teamed up to plant those stories - writing that 'everyone knew he and Allison had Page Six on speed dial.' Jeff then became the president of CNN onJanuary 1, 2013. Reuniting at CNN: How Jeff brought Allison on-board as his first hire After leaving NBC, Allison took a job as then-New York Governor Andrew Cuomo's communications director at the end of 2012. However, just four months later, it was revealed that she had quit the role and was moving to CNN. '[Jeff's] first hire?' Katie wrote in her book. 'Allison Gollust.' She was hired at the company as senior vice president of communications. 'Allison is among the most experienced and respected communications executives in the media industry, and her close working relationship with Jeff Zucker is one of its most successful professional partnerships,' Jeff Matteson, senior vice president of communications for Turner Broadcasting System, Inc., said at the time. Jeff added in a statement: 'In the 15 years that Allison and I have worked together, I’ve depended on her judgment, counsel and relationships. 'Allison is joining CNN at an exciting time, and she and the strong communications team she’s inheriting will play a critical role in shaping the organization and its story going forward. It’s great to have her at CNN.' Living in close quarters: Pair spark speculation after moving into the same apartment building just one floor apart Jeff and Allison lived in the same apartment building on the Upper East Side with their respective families until Jeff sold his in 2020, after he and his ex-wife - supervisor of Saturday Night Life Caryn Stephanie Nathanson - split. The building is located at on the corner of Madison Avenue in Manhattan, New York. He resided in apartment 3W, while Allison lived in the unit right above him - number 4W - which she still owns. Katie later claimed that their 'cozy arrangement' was 'super strange' and made her 'really uncomfortable.' She said in her book: '[Allison] and her husband and kids had moved into the apartment right above Jeff and [his wife] Caryn’s - everyone who heard about their cozy arrangement thought it was super strange. 'By that point, Caryn had become a close friend and it made me really uncomfortable.' Allison's apartment has two bedrooms and two and a half bathrooms, while Jeff's contained five bedrooms and four and a half bathrooms. He sold it for $15.4 million. Both of them also own Hampton houses within 20 minutes from one another. According to public sales records, Jeff's home hasn't been put up for sale since he purchased it in 1999 - however it's not known whether he or his wife took ownership of it in the divorce. Records also show that Allison still owners her Hampton home. Leaving their respective partners: Lengthy marriages both end in divorce Jeff and his ex-wife split in 2018 after 21 years of marriage, due to reportedly 'growing apart.' A source toldPage Six at the time: 'It can’t be easy being married to Jeff - he is a workaholic, and is obsessed with news, and obsessed with being the best. 'Caryn is much more laid back and social, spends a lot of time with their kids and enjoys being part of the Upper East Side social circuit. 'They’ve had their problems over the years. Things have been bad for 10 years, but they have now accepted their marriage is over, and he has moved out of their apartment.' The former couple share four kids together - three daughters and a son. As for Allison, she was previously married to Billy Hult,the president of online marketplace platform Tradeweb. According to RadarOnline, they broke up 12 months after Jeff and Caryn finalized their divorced. Before they split, they welcomed two daughters together namedOlivia and Ava. Now, sources have claimed that both of their marriages ended because of their budding romance. An insider told DailyMail.com on Wednesday: 'It was part of the reason for his divorce, but not the only reason. It was inevitable that it would come out – he should have been up front sooner.' Going public with their romance: Couple claim their 'relationship changed during COVID' According to Allison, who said she will remain at the network, however, it wasn't until the COVID-19 pandemic hit that things turned romantic between them. 'Jeff and I have been close friends and professional partners for over 20 years,' she wrote. 'Recently, our relationship changed during COVID,' she said in a statement released to the New York Times. 'I regret that we didn't disclose it at the right time. I'm incredibly proud of my time at CNN and look forward to continuing the great work we do everyday.' In a memo to CNN staff on Wednesday, Jeff spoke out about it too. He said: 'As part of the investigation into Chris Cuomo's tenure at CNN, I was asked about a consensual relationship with my closest colleague, someone I have worked with for more than 20 years. 'I acknowledged the relationship evolved in recent years. I was required to disclose it when it began but I didn't. I was wrong.' Insiders claim couple had 'open-secret affair for years' According to a CNN source, their romance was no secret to those who worked with them, and the insider insisted that it started years before the pandemic - despite Allison claiming that it didn't blossom until later. 'Jeff’s affair with Allison has been going on forever – not since COVID! Everyone has known it but he still denied it,' they said. Another insider told DailyMail.com: 'It was the worst kept secret inside the building.' 'Jeff’s office was right next to Allison’s office at Hudson Yards and before that at the Time Warner Center on Columbus Circle. 'The joke was they weren’t only sharing a wall. No one believes that this only happened over pandemic. They have been close for years. 'The closest it ever came to being outed was when Page Six reported on their “heavy exchange” at the Hollywood Reporter’s 35 Most Powerful People in NY Media party. 'They had a very public fight at the party that didn’t seem to have anything to do with work.' The fight they're referring to took place in 2017. An onlooker revealed to the outlet at the time that while the party was taking place, Jeff and Allison suddenly started intensely speaking and making anguished hand gestures before she stormed away into the crowd. 'It looked like she was reprimanding her husband or something,' said an unnamed rival news executive, who witnessed the argument. The couple was also spotted together at a Billy Joel concert last November, where they were called out by a fan for defying mask regulations at the event. 1986:Jeff hired as an Olympic researcher for NBC 1989: Jeff starts working as producer on Today 1996:Jeff marries his NBC colleague Caryn Nathanson 2000: Jeff promoted to president of entertainment at NBC after boosting ratings on Today He meets Allison at NBC. 2003:Jeff promoted to head of news, cable and entertainment at NBC 2005:Jeff becomes head of NBC Universal, new umbrella brand 2007:Jeff becomes President and CEO of NBC Universal 2010:Jeff leaves NBC, taking a package of between $30m - $40m dollars 2011: Jeff joins Katie Couric as producer on her ABC show 2012:Jeff joins CNN 2018: Jeff and his wife Caryn split 2021: Jeff announces plans to leave the company at the end of the year.

36,"Dolphins owner 'could face criminal probe for bribery' after fired coach Brian Flores claimed he offered him $100,000 for every loss to improve the team's 2020 draft position",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10470093/Dolphins-owner-face-criminal-probe-bribery-following-Brian-Floress-lawsuit.html,"A pair of NFL owners could potentially face bribery charges following accusations from two former head coaches, who say they were offered money from their bosses to tank games in order to obtain higher draft picks. Former Miami Dolphins head coach Brian Flores claims his refusal to throw games as a way to land a top draft pick ultimately cost him his job. Flores, who was fired last month by Miami, alleged in a proposed class action complaint on Tuesday that Dolphins owner Stephen Ross offered him $100,000 for every loss in 2019 as an incentive to help the team land a higher draft pick in 2020. Meanwhile former Cleveland head coach Hue Jackson implied on social media that he was paid to tank by Browns owner Jimmy Haslam, adding that he has proof. In a series of back-and-forth tweets Tuesday regarding Flores' lawsuit, Jackson posted that Haslam 'was happy while we kept losing.' In a subsequent tweet, Jackson posted, 'Trust me, it was a good number!' In yet another tweet, he wrote, 'I can back up every word I'm saying.' As reported by Pro Football Talk's Mike Florio, who is also a lawyer, the Sports Bribery Act 'criminalizes such conduct.' Under 18 U.S.C. § 224: 'Whoever carries into effect, attempts to carry into effect, or conspires with any other person to carry into effect any scheme in commence to influence, in any way, by bribery any sporting contest, with knowledge of the purpose of such scheme is to influence by bribery that contests, shall be fined under this title, or imprisoned not more than 5 years, or both.' As Florio explained, the offer does not have to be accepted in order to convict. Flores has claimed he refused to lose games at Ross's request. According to the law, there is only liability if the accused 'carries into effect' a scheme or bribe. So the offer of $100,000 could constitute a violation. There's no indication that authorities are looking into the matter, but as Florio noted, 'federal prosecutors have broad discretion as to the cases they will bring or not bring.' Asked to comment on Flores' accusations, the Dolphins referred Reuters to a statement the team issued on Tuesday that said 'the implication that we acted in a manner inconsistent with the integrity of the game is incorrect.' The Browns responded in a statement on Wednesday: 'The recent comments by Hue Jackson and his representatives relating to his tenure as our head coach are completely fabricated. Any accusation that any member of our organization was incentivized to deliberately lose games is categorically false.' The NFL did not immediately respond to DailyMail.com's request for comment on Wednesday evening. Jackson, now the head coach at Grambling State, went 3-36-1 in parts of three seasons in Cleveland. The executive director of the Hue Jackson Foundation, Kimberly Diemert, separately congratulated Flores for his 'bravery' and invited him to direct message her, saying, 'We have records that will help your case. ... They did this @Browns.' Diemert said Jackson along with team executives Paul DePodesta and Andrew Berry -- now the team's general manager -- received bonuses to tank in 2016 and 2017. The Browns went 1-31 those two seasons under Jackson. The Browns selected defensive end Myles Garrett No. 1 overall in the 2017 draft and then quarterback Baker Mayfield No. 1 overall in the 2018 draft. Jackson was fired after a 2-5-1 start in the 2018 season. The thrust of Flores's lawsuit was to accuse the NFL and its 32 teams of discriminating against black candidates for coaching and management jobs. Flores is the Brooklyn-born son of black Honduran immigrants. The NFL, in a statement on Tuesday responding to the suit, said the claims of racial bias were without merit and that its clubs were committed to ensuring equitable employment practices. 'This game's done a lot for me. I grew up not far from here in the projects in Brownsville, Brooklyn. I didn't grow up with a lot. This game, you know, changed my life,' Flores, in his first interview since the lawsuit was filed, told 'CBS Mornings' on Wednesday when asked about the alleged financial incentive. 'So, to attack the integrity of the game, that's what I felt was happening in that instance. And I wouldn't stand for it ... I think it hurt my standing within the organization and ultimately was the reason why I was let go.' Miami's decision to part ways with Flores was one of the more surprising head coach firings of the 2021 NFL season given the Dolphins won eight of their final nine games after starting the season 1-7. Flores, who took over a struggling Miami team in 2019, went 24-25 during his three seasons in charge but failed to lead them to the playoffs, a drought that dates back to the 2016 season. He says he was humiliated by having to go through a 'sham' interview process for the New York Giants head coaching job after text messages from Patriots coach Bill Belichick showed he was never a real candidate for the position. 'It was a range of emotions,' Flores told CBS' Nate Burleson, a former NFL player, about his interview with the Giants. 'Humiliation, disbelief, anger.' Belichick was apparently trying to message former Buffalo Bills offensive coordinator Brian Daboll, who had already interviewed for the Giants position and was ultimately given the job. Informed by Belichick's text messages, Flores now believes the Giants already knew they were hiring Daboll and were simply interviewing him to comply with the NFL's Rooney Rule, which requires teams to meet with at least one outside minority candidate for top coaching and executive positions. Named for late Pittsburgh Steelers owner Dan Rooney, the Rooney Rule is an NFL policy requiring teams to interview ethnic minorities for head coaching and top executive positions. However, despite the rule being on the books since 2003, the NFL currently has only one black head coach, the Steelers' Mike Tomlin. Flores said he was disappointed to be going into an interview for the Giants' job with the knowledge that he wasn't truly a candidate. 'I've worked so hard to get to where I am in football, to become a head coach,' he said. 'Put 18 years in this league, and to go [into] what felt like or what was a sham interview, I was hurt.' The Patriots have not made Belichick available for comment since the lawsuit was filed Tuesday, nor have the Giants done so with Daboll. Flores says his lawsuit against the NFL will continue even if he becomes a head coach again this offseason. He has interviewed with the Houston Texans and New Orleans Saints, who have yet to fill their coaching vacancies. If they call, Flores will listen, but he said the suit will go on because the league needs change. 'This is about changing the hiring practices in the National Football League, and that's what this lawsuit is about,' Flores said Wednesday on CNN. 'I want to coach football that's what I'm called to do.' Flores said he knows others have similar stories and that it is hard to speak out. He called his potential sacrifice bigger than football or coaching. The NFL is at a fork in the road, he said. 'We're going keep it the way it is or go in another direction and make some change where we're actually changing the hearts and minds of those who make decisions to hire head coaches, executives, et cetera,' Flores said on CBS. 'That's what we've got to get to. We've got to change hearts and minds.' Around 70 percent of NFL players are African Americans, but despite that, the NFL has only one black head coach, the Pittsburgh Steelers' Mike Tomlin. To Flores, this is a sign that the NFL's Rooney Rule is ineffective. 'We didn't have to file a lawsuit for the world to know that there's a problem from a hiring standpoint in regards to minority coaches in the national football league,' he said. 'The numbers speak for themselves. 'The Rooney rule's intended to give minorities an opportunity to sit down in front of ownership, but I think what it's turned into is - an instance where guys are checking the box. That's been the case. I've been on some interviews in the past that were I've had that feeling. There's always no way to know for sure, but... I know I'm not alone.' Flores also said he knows he may have damaged his career by filing the lawsuit. 'I understand the risks, and yes, it was a difficult decision,' he said, adding that he hopes to continue as an NFL head coach. 'I love coaching, I'm gifted to coach, I know that,' Flores continued. 'The relationships I built with players, coaches, support staff, I'm gifted to coach, I love coaching and I want to coach ... This is bigger than coaching. This is much bigger than coaching.' Flores is 24-25 as a head coach, but called plays for the Patriots defense when New England held the LA Rams to just three points in a Super Bowl LIII win. Flores's lawsuit, filed in Manhattan Federal Court, included text messages in which Belichick, his former boss, mistakenly congratulated him for getting hired by the Giants before he even interviewed with the team. Apparently Belichick intended to text another Brian, former Buffalo Bills offensive coordinator Brian Daboll, who had already interviewed twice and was ultimately hired for the position. 'There was back and forth,' Flores said about his text exchange with Belichick. 'I asked, ''are you talking to the right Brian?'' And as you have seen through the text messages, he was actually -- thought he was texting Brian Daboll.' The text message from Belichick to his former assistant began with the Patriots coach saying, 'Sounds like you have landed - congrats!!' A confused Flores responded: 'Did you hear something I didn't here?' 'I interview on Thursday. I think I have a shot.' Belichick assured him that he does. 'Got it. I hear from Buffalo & NYG that you are their guy. Hope it works out if you want it to!!' Flores then told his mentor that he hopes he's right before questioning whether Belichick has reached out to the right person. 'Coach, are you talking to Brian Flores or Brian Daboll. Just making sure.' Belichick quickly realized his shocking fumble. 'Sorry. I f***ed this up. I double checked and misread my text. I think they are naming Daboll. I'm sorry about that. BB' The now-shattered Flores signed off: 'Thanks Bill.' The Giants announced that they hired Daboll on January 28. In a statement, the team denied Flores's accusations of racism. 'We are pleased and confident with the process that resulted in the hiring of Brian Daboll,' the statement said. 'We interviewed an impressive and diverse group of candidates. The fact of the matter is, Brian Flores was in the conversation to be our head coach until the eleventh hour. Ultimately, we hired the individual we felt was most qualified to be our next head coach.' The team declined to make Daboll available for comment when contacted by DailyMail.com. Speaking to the CBS roundtable on Wednesday, Flores stressed that he has no problem with NFL teams hiring the most qualified candidate, but expressed skepticism over whether or not that's the case. 'That's very reasonable to me,' Flores said when asked if team should be able to hire the best candidates. 'But at the same time, I know of a lot of very capable coaches, executives, minorities, coaches, executives who are minorities, and in a lot of cases are as qualified, more qualified, and frankly better than their white counterparts.' Former Giants quarterback Eli Manning defended the team to the New York Post. 'I was not involved in any of that process in any way, so I don't know the details,' Manning told The Post. 'I know the Giants organization. I know they do everything possible to give everybody a fair chance. They don't care minority or not, they are looking for the best possible candidate. They are going to do everything properly to look for that perfect candidate. 'So, I don't think there was any wrongdoing there.' Marvin Lewis, the African-American former head coach of the Cincinnati Bengals, suggested on Wednesday that he was given a similar sham interview with the Carolina Panthers in 2002, when they ultimately hired John Fox. 'I did interview with the Carolina Panthers before John Fox got the job,' Lewis told ESPN on Wednesday. 'And I can recall that we had lost to the Steelers in the second round of the playoffs and I remember sitting at home on Monday and, I think it was [ESPN reporter] Chris Mortenson or someone else, they reported that Foxy would be named the head coach of the Panthers on Friday. 'And when I went to work Tuesday, [Ravens head coach Brian Billick] came in, said I just got off the phone with [Ravens GM Ozzie Newsome] and the Panthers want you to come down and interview for the job. 'I said, coach, I just heard last night on TV that they're gonna name Foxy the coach on Friday,' continued Lewis, who was working as a Ravens assistant in 2002. 'So he goes back, he talks to Ozzie, he talks to their people, and I end up going down to Charlotte and meeting with the Richardson family and they said that wasn't true and so forth. And they named John the head coach on Friday. 'So, you know, I don't know, again, that's the situation I was in. But you have to go. You have to go and prove that you're worthy to become the head coach. You're appreciative of the opportunity but what was supposedly gonna happen ended up happening in that case for sure.' Richardson, the founding owner of the Carolina Panthers, was forced to sell the team in 2017 amid allegations of racism and sexist behavior."

More than a dozen HBCUs - including Howard University, Kentucky State University and Morgan State, received bombs threats at the start of Black History Month on Tuesday. As a result, the FBI said it was investigating six 'tech savvy' juveniles, whose identities were not released, who are believed to have made the racially motivated threats. 'These threats are being investigated as racially or ethnically motivated violent extremism and hate crimes,' the federal agency wrote in a press release on Wednesday. 'This investigation is of the highest priority for the Bureau and involves more than 20 FBI field offices across the country.' Although 'no explosive devices were been found at any of the locations', the FBI said it was 'committed to thoroughly and aggressively investigating these threats.' No charges have been pressed yet. Scroll down for video Source: NBC News Howard University was one of the first to receive a shelter-in-place order on Tuesday. Students received the notification around 3.30am. The school would issue an 'all clear' notification around 7.30am. 'The Metropolitan Police Department (MPD) and the Howard University Department of Police have issued an 'ALL CLEAR' in the investigation of a bomb threat made this morning at approximately 2:55 a.m. The Shelter-In-Place directive has been lifted,' the school tweeted at 7.30am on Tuesday.

'The secret of Bob’s great life is that he became a ""whosoever."" He left a legacy of not just how to live but how to die,' Black said. The band played America the Beautiful as the casket team folded his flag. Joint Chiefs of Staff General Mark Milley went down on one knee to hand it to former Sen. Elizabeth Dole. Dole, who was wounded in World War II, served nearly 36 years in Congress and was the GOP’s leader in the Senate for more than a decade. In February 2021, he announced he had been diagnosed with cancer. Dole has been celebrated for his military service, advocating for veterans and spearheading the drive to get the World War II Memorial built on the National Mall in Washington. In December, Dole lay in state at the U.S. Capitol, as President Biden and others gathered to pay tribute to an 'American giant.' At Dole's burial service Wednesday, a three-volley salute and the playing of taps was followed by the folding of the flag adorning Dole’s casket and presented to his family. Dole now rests alongside around 400,000 other distinguished military members buried at Arlington over the last 150 years. His widow, Elizabeth Dole, former Cabinet secretary and North Carolina Sen. Elizabeth Dole, was in attendance, along with about 00 close family members close friends. Dole, a native of Russell in western Kansas, was the 1996 Republican presidential nominee, losing that year to incumbent Democrat Bill Clinton. He served nearly 36 years in Congress and was the GOP’s leader in the Senate for more than a decade. While Dole could be sharply partisan, he has been remembered as a pragmatic congressional leader willing to compromise to pass legislation such as the landmark Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990. He also was known for his self-deprecating wit. Dole has been celebrated for his military service, advocating for veterans and spearheading the drive to get the World War II Memorial built on the National Mall in Washington. He was severely wounded in fighting as a 21-year-old Army platoon leader in northern Italy in 1945. As he charged a German position, a shell fragment hit him, crushing two vertebrae and paralyzing his arms and legs. He spent three years recovering in a hospital and never regained use of his right hand. He became a lawyer and began his political career in the early 1950s with a term in the Kansas House."
39,The gloomy state of the nation under Biden: Just 33% are satisfied with the economy and confidence in the military DROPS 10% in another dire poll that shows mood is worsening across most aspects of life,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10468591/Gallup-poll-finds-Americans-gloomy-state-nation-Biden.html,"Americans' overall dissatisification with the state of the country is on a downward trend, according to a new Gallup poll, which shows declines in 10 major policy areas, including energy policy, the military, and the economy. Gallup's annual Mood of the Nation survey reflected a continual dour mood in the country as the coronavirus pandemic continues and President Joe Biden enters his second year in office. Americans' satisfaction with the economy dropped 10 points over the last year and a whopping 35 points over the past two years, a reflection of the country's frustration with the fallout from the pandemic, which saw businesses shutter, large numbers of people quit, and dire jobs numbers. Inflation is also likely a major factor in the declining number. It hit a record 7 per cent in December - a nearly 40 year high. Adminstration officials have defended Biden's stewardship of the economy, pointing to the low unemployment rate. Arecord number of people quit their jobs during Biden’s first year – with a record 4.5 million in November. The administration argues this is because the job market is competitive and that people want higher wages and better benefits. Wages are up – the average hourly pay jumped 4.7% in December compared with a year ago.But the economy is still about 3.6 million jobs short of its pre-pandemic level. Additionally, Americans' faith in military strength and preparedness dropped 20 points over two years and their satisfaction in energy policy is down 17 points over two years, Gallup's survey found. Higher gas prices, Gallup said in its analysis, are the likely for the country's frustration with energy policy. Prices also have risen for food and rent. And the chaotic Afghanistan withdrawal that resulted in the deaths of 13 U.S. service members may still be affecting Americans' thoughts on military preparedness. Biden defended his decision to end that conflict, arguing the cost would have been higher if the United States had remained mired in the country.Democrats and Republicans alike criticized his handling of the situation. ‘I'm the fourth president who has faced the issue of whether and when to end this war. When I was running for president, I made a commitment to the American people that I would end this war. Today I've honored that commitment,’ the president said in August when he announced his exit strategy. The Mood of the Nation surveyalso found there was a 23 point drop over the past two years in confidence in the nation's policies to reduce or control crime. The country has seena dramatic rise in violent crime during the pancemic where at least 12 major U.S. cities broken annual homicide records last year. Gallup's survey was conducted Jan. 3-16. The company asked Americans to indicate how satisfied they are with eight aspects of the U.S., including the quality of life, opportunity and the governmental system. The survey also polled on 21 different policy areas. Other policy areas that saw declines were abortion policy - the issue has been back in the news thanks to a new, restrictive law enacted in Texas - government regulation of business, and the quality in both medical care and education. Democrats, in particular, were dissatisified with abortion policy. There was a 14 point drop among that group - the only policy area that saw meaningful decline among President Biden's party. In a good sign, 69 per cent ofU.S. adults are satisfied with the overall quality of life in the U.S. - the highest for any item measured in the survey. But that percentage was down from 84 per cent happy with quality life in 2020. It is closer to the 67 per cent measured last year - survey that came after the deadliest phase of the coronavirus pandemic and the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol. In only one area - acceptance of gays and lesbians - Gallup foundmore Americans satisfied now than were in 2020, before the coronavirus pandemic. Earlier this month, Biden defended his first year on the jobby bragging he has 'outperformed' expectations. In his remarks marking one year in office, he began by tackling the two issues that are behind his own falling poll numbers: the COVID pandemic and the record high inflation hurting the economy. The president'sapproval rating has dropped to the low 40s as voters give him low marks on those two issues. 'It's been a year of challenges but also been a year of enormous progress,' Biden."
40,"Senator Ben Ray Luján, 49, may be away for up to six weeks recovering from stroke: Psaki sidesteps question on if his absence will delay Biden's agenda even further",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10470177/Senator-Ben-Luj-n-49-away-six-weeks-recovering-stroke.html,"The Senate's majority Democrats will have to function for more than a month without Sen. Ben Ray Luján as the New Mexico senator recovers from a stroke he suffered last week, according to a timeline put out by his office. He plans to return to the Senate in four to six weeks, a senior aide in the 49-year-old senator's office said Wednesday – which would be two weeks after President Joe Biden self-imposed deadline for announcing a nominee to fill the seat of retiring Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer. Lujánchecked himself into a hospital in Santa Fe last Thursday after he began to experience dizziness and fatigue, according to his chief of staff, who said Luján is expected to make a full recovery. He was transferred to a hospital in Albuquerque, where he remains. Progressives are pushing Biden and party leaders to act fast, noting that the Senate pushed through President Donald Trump's nomination of Justice Amy Coney Barrett in just 35 days in the rush to confirm her before the 2020 elections. The four to six month timeframe isbarring any complications, the aide told the Associated Press. Even after Biden's nomination, the Senate Judiciary Committee needs time to vet the nominee and review mountains of paperwork, depending on if Biden chooses someone with a long judicial record or other paper trail. White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki commented on Luján's absence, following a reminder by Delaware Sen. Chris Coons that 'it's just a reminder that in a 50-50 Senate, any unexpected development could be a challenge to our moving forward on an agenda that the Democratic caucus shares.' Said Psaki: 'Well, life is precious, as we know. You are most familiar with the average age of senators in the Senate, but that is true on both sides of the aisle,' she added, speaking of a chamber where the oldest Republican and Democratic senators are each 88 years old. 'I would just say, we spend most of our time engaging in good faith about the president's agenda and not making those calculations,' she said, steering clear of the topic of Biden's agenda being potentially stalled for a period of time. 'Of course, we're thinking about him, his family, his entire team, at this point in time,' said Psaki. While Luján is out, Democrats will only be able to pass legislation or nominees if it is non-controversial or can garner GOP support. The Republican filibuster has already prevented the majority from passing initiatives that can get majority support. Biden's Build Back Better plan remains short of such a majority anyway. Even Senate Democratic leaders were caught off guard by the news of Luján's condition, which broke Tuesday. Senate Majority Leader Charles Schumer met with Biden at the White House to discuss the looming Supreme Court fight. He described the 'awful, frightening' situation of one of the Senate's younger members falling suddenly ill. He predicted Luján, a former House member, would be 'back to his old self.' 'All of us are rooting for him every step of the way - between now and the day he makes his return to the Senate,' Schumer said. Luján sits on two key committees, the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions panel and the Commerce Committee – which already began putting off scheduled nominations. According to a statement Luján office released Tuesday: 'Senator Luján was found to have suffered a stroke in the cerebellum, affecting his balance. As part of his treatment plan, he subsequently underwent decompressive surgery to ease swelling.' Even before the news aboutLuján, Democrats had struggled to push through Biden's ambitious agenda with just 50 votes. Two centrists, Joe Manchin and Krysten Sinema, were able to stall his $1.8 trillion Build Back Better plan, which has seen no movement since before Christmas."
41,"PICTURED: Missouri teacher, 26, her student lover who she married to avoid jail, and their BABY ",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10469991/MO-teacher-married-student-accused-having-sex-child-him.html,"A former Missouri high school teacher who was charged with having sex with her student has the charges against her dropped after she married him and gave birth to their child. Prosecutors have dropped charges against Baylee A. Turner, 26,after she married the student she was accused of having sex with. In February 2019, Turner - who was then 23 - was charged with having sexual contact with one of her male students followingan investigation by the Jasper County Sheriff's Department, the Joplin Globe reported. The former Sarcoxie High School teacher was a first-year English teacher at the high school when she was accused of having sexual intercourse with the student - then aged 18 - leading to her resignation. Both Turner and the student acknowledged that they had sex the week of January 14-21 in 2019 at Turner's home in Sarcoxie, about 260 miles southwest of St. Louis, court documents show. According to Facebook, Turner and the student married in May 2019 several months after the scandal and then welcomed their first child in February 2020. Turner's student-turned-spouse is now 22 years old. The couple and their families did not respond to DailyMail.com for a comment. Assistant prosecutor Nate Dally told the Globe that the charge against her was being dismissed after she married the student, whose identity has not been revealed. Dally said that because the former student now has marital or spousal privilege, he can no longer be compelled to testify against his wife, weakening the state's case in court. Missouri state lawprohibits school employees, volunteers or officials from having sexual contact with a student regardless of consent or age. Turner taught English at the Sarcoxie middle school for two years before being assigned to teach high school sophomores and seniors in 2019. She resigned from the high school after her arrest in February 2019. Turner was facing up to four years in prison.The court had ordered her not to have contact with anyone younger than 16 when she was released after posting a $10,000 bond. Dally added that Turner has surrendered her state teaching license, which was one of the prosecutors' main goals. The Globe reported that Turner was one of six young educators in the state that have been accused of having sex with students in recent years. The case echoes the infamous relationshipbetween Washington state teacher Mary Kay Letourneau and sixth-grade student Vili Fualaau. Letourneau met Fualaau when he joined her second grade class in 1992, but they did not begin their sexual relationship until four years later when he was 12 years old. In 1997, Letourneau made international headlines when the then-34-year-old pleaded guilty to raping Vili when he was 12-years-old. She was pregnant with her former student's child at the time of her conviction. Letourneau was then paroled in 1998 but was once again found having sex with Fualaau in a car. A judge then revoked Letourneau's prior plea agreement and ordered her to serve seven years in prison on second-degree child rape charges for violating the no-contact order. She gave birth to her second child withFualaau while in prison.He was 14-years-old at the time. The couple ended up tying the knot in 2005 and raised their two children together beforeFualaau filed for separation in 2017.Letourneau died of colon cancer in 2020 at the age of 58."
42,Trump considered a blanket pardon on ALL January 6 defendants before he left office so suspects would 'never be testify or be deposed' ,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10469717/Trump-considered-blanket-pardon-January-6-defendants-left-office.html,"Donald Trump floated the idea of issuing a blanket pardon for people who took part in the Jan. 6th Capitol riot during his last days in office, according to a new report – which comes after the former president suggested the idea at a Saturday rally. Trump caused an uproar with his recent comments, when he promised to treat 'those people from January 6 fairly' if he runs and wins the White House.'And if it requires pardons we will give them pardons because they are being treated so unfairly,' he said. Following the January 6th Capitol riot, when there was already talk of potential legal exposure for organizers, Trump spoke to advisors about issuing a potential 'blanket' pardon for the people who stormed the Capitol, Politicoreported. One advisor summarized the conversations as Trump asking: 'Do you think I should pardon them? Do you think it’s a good idea? Do you think I have the power to do it?' Another advisor is quoted saying Trump discussed how people who received pardons would never have to testify be deposed. He told the advisor that 'some people think I should pardon them,' and asked questions about the scope such as: 'Is iteverybody that had a Trump sign or everybody who walked into the Capitol?' That suggests Trump was discussing a sweeping order that would have included those who engaged in violent clashes with police. At the time, the FBI was only beginning its nationwide manhunt, which has charged people with hundreds of offenses involving poles, bear spray, and other weapons. The government has charged a group of Oath Keepers with seditious conspiracy, and has sketched out a plan to ferry a weapons cache to the Virginia suburbs. Trump made extensive use of the pardon power, and did not hold back from using it in cases close to home. Among those he pardoned are former National Security Advisor Mike Flynn, former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon, longtime informal advisor Roger Stone, and former campaign chair Paul Manafort – with Manafort, Bannon and Stone getting pardons during Trump's last days in office. Trump's comments at his Texas rally drew blowback from House Jan. 6th Committee members. California Democratic Rep. Pete Aguillar said it was 'absolutely' witness tampering. 'And I think the question is more from my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, you know where -- where are they? Do they support this? When is enough enough?' he asked on CNN. Rep. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.) tweeted in response: 'Trump uses language he knows caused the Jan 6 violence; suggests he'd pardon the Jan 6 defendants, some of whom have been charged with seditious conspiracy; threatens prosecutors; and admits he was attempting to overturn the election. He'd do it all again if given the chance.' Allies during Trump's last weeks in office were urging him to consider issuing 'preemptive pardons' of associates to head off what Trump continues to call a 'witch hunt' of probes. That discussion continued until his last hours in office – including public discussions of whether he could or should pardon participants in the Capitol riot."
43,"Son of New York City judge pleads guilty to taking part in Capitol riot where he wore a fur costume, referred to himself as 'caveman' and stole a police bullet proof vest ",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10469311/Brooklyn-judges-son-pleads-guilty-Capitol-riot-charges.html,"The son of a New York City judge who referred to himself as a 'caveman' eager to protest Donald Trump´s presidential election loss pleaded guilty Wednesday to charges he stormed the U.S. Capitol during the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection. Aaron Mostofsky was seen inside the Capitol wearing a fur costume and a police bullet proof vest that he was accused of stealing during the mayhem. He also gave a video interview inside the building, telling the New York Post he was there 'to express my opinion as a free American that this election was stolen.' Mostofsky, 35, pleaded guilty to charges of civil disorder, theft of government property and entering and remaining in a restricted building or grounds. He is scheduled to be sentenced May 6. Mostofsky faces 12 to 18 months in prison under federal sentencing guidelines, U.S. District Judge James Boasberg said. Mostofsky also agreed to pay $2,000 restitution. The defendant's father is Shlomo Mostofsky, a state court judge in Brooklyn. A message seeking comment was left with a court spokesperson. Aaron Mostofsky's unusual garb made him stand out from the crowd of camouflage-wearing, flag-waving rioters. At one point, he was photographed sitting on a bench near the Senate chamber holding a stick and the riot shield, which he said he picked up off the floor. According to prosecutors, Mostofsky took a bus from New York to Washington and joined protesters in overwhelming a police line and storming the Capitol. Along the way, he picked up and put on the bullet proof vest, valued at $1,905, and the riot shield, worth $265, prosecutors said. Before the protest, Mostofsky messaged another demonstrator that he could be found at the protest by looking for 'a caveman,' adding, 'Even a caveman knows it was stolen,' prosecutors said. Afterward, as his photo circulated, he said the image was unfortunate because 'now people actually know me.' More than 730 people have been charged with federal crimes related to the Capitol riot. More than 200 of them have pleaded guilty, mostly to misdemeanors punishable by a maximum of six months imprisonment. Mostofsky is one of approximately two dozen rioters to plead guilty to a felony. More than 90 riot defendants have been sentenced. A judge had ordered him upon his release to reside with his brother, Nachman Mostofsky. Mostofsky's travel had been limited to New York City. If he needs to travel outside the jurisdiction, he will need to acquire permission. He was also told to surrender his passport and he will be under a curfew. He was also ordered not to have contact with co-defendants or co-conspirators involved in the riot on the Capitol. His attorney, Jeffrey Schwartz, told the court last year: 'I believe evidence will show that he was not part of the mob, he was not rampaging, he got caught up in it.' 'He will stay far away from Washington, any political rallies, he will have nothing to do with any of that stuff,' Schwartz added. 'He understands how the thing in Washington got out of hand... I can ensure the court that his only interests now is to address the charges against him.' Nachman Mostofsky, who also attended the rally but claimed he did not enter the Capitol building said back in 2021 that his brother 'did nothing illegal' and 'was pushed inside'. Other images ofAaron Mostofsky showed him holding a police shield that he claimed he found on the floor. A spokesman for Shlomo Mostofsky, told the New York Postat the time of his son's arrest: 'Justice Mostofsky has no knowledge of these unfortunate events.'"
44,REVEALED: Miss USA Cheslie Kryst's mom posts emotional message saying she battled 'high-functioning depression which she hid from everyone' before jumping to her death from NYC apartment building ,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10470013/Miss-USA-Cheslie-Kryst-battled-high-functioning-depression-hid-mom-says.html,"A former beauty queen who leaped from a Manhattan apartment building to her death battled high-functioning depression, her mom has revealed. April Simpkins said she is 'forever changed' the death of her daughter Cheslie Kryst, a former Miss USA whose bubbly and vivacious personality masked inner struggles. 'Cheslie led both a public and a private life,' Simpkins shared on Instagram. 'In her private life, she was dealing with high-functioning depression which she hid from everyone - including me, her closest confidant - until very shortly before her death.' Kryst, 30, was discovered on a sidewalk next to her luxury apartment building The Orion in Hell's Kitchen on Sunday morning. Although she lived alone in the complex's ninth floor, she was last seen in a common area on an open terrace on the 29th level. 'While her life on this earth was short, it was filled with many beautiful memories,' her mom said. 'We miss her laugh, her words of wisdom, her sense of humor and mostly her hugs. We miss all of it - we miss all of her. She was a vital part of our family which makes this loss even more devastating.' Simpkins described her daughter as a 'ball of sunshine wrapped in smiles.' 'We talked, FaceTimed or texted one another all day, every day. You were more than a daughter - you were my very best friend,' she said. 'Talking with you was one of the best parts of my day. Your smile and laugh were infectious. 'I love you baby girl with all my heart. I miss you desperately. I know one day we'll be together again. Until then, rest easy and in peace.' The proud mom - who was won a tiara as Mrs. North Carolina in 2002 - has for years been relishing her daughter's accomplishments.She traveled to Israel last December to watch the 2021 Miss Universe with Kryst, who worked as an Extra correspondent. Kryst was crowned Miss USA in 2019 and was among the 10 contestants in the ensuing Miss Universe that year. In a haunting essay last March, just 10 months before leaping to her death, Kryst talked about the fear that she was 'running out of time to matter.' She wrote about being trolled online and how winning Miss USA at the age of 28 made her a target for ageist bullies, but many of her friends said on Monday they were stunned by her death and were unaware that she might have been suffering mental health issues. Publicly, she never shared any particular struggles with mental health. In 2019, she said that she often spoke with a counselor to keep her mind healthy, but there was no indication that she was in any form of distress. Her father, 62-year-old Rodney Kryst, said earlier this week that he believed she was depressed due to 'family disfunction.' 'She was sad,' he told the New York Post. He also said she was 'pure' and didn't suffer from substance abuse problems. Before her death, she shared one last photo of herself on Instagram captioned: 'May this day bring you rest and peace.' Kryst was the oldest person to have won Miss USA and she also strayed from the norm with her passion for social justice; she was a trained lawyer and Black Lives Matter advocate. In recent TikTok videos, she revealed that she no longer wanted to practice law because she had become sick of what she called constant micro-aggressions and a lack of diversity. In a video posted last week, she explained to a fan that she struggled to meet billable hours requirements, and that it felt like 'trading in hours of my life in order to get paid.' Kryst was one of six siblings. She recently traveled to South Carolina to spend the holidays with her mother, a former beauty queen, and brothers and sisters. Her grandfather in South Carolina told The New York Daily News he was stunned by her death. 'To be extinguished so fast is just devastating,' Gary Fimpkins said. 'She was such a fantastic person. She was kind. She was generous. She felt for other people. 'She tried to help other people. She was just one of those rare people that had a heart for people.' Writing ahead of her 30th birthday for Allure magazine, she said hauntingly: 'Each time I say 'I'm turning 30,' I cringe a little. Sometimes I can successfully mask this uncomfortable response with excitement; other times, my enthusiasm feels hollow, like bad acting...turning 30 feels like a cold reminder that I'm running out of time to matter in society's eyes - and it's infuriating.' She told how after she won the pageant in 2019, some petitioned for the age limit to be lowered because they thought she was too old and how she was trolled on social media for her athletic body, having to delete 'vomit emojis' beneath some of her photos on Instagram. 'My challenge of the status quo certainly caught the attention of the trolls, and I can't tell you how many times I have deleted comments on my social media pages that had vomit emojis and insults telling me I wasn't pretty enough to be Miss USA or that my muscular build was actually a 'man body.'' She talked about ringing in her 29th birthday alone in her apartment, wearing her Miss USA crown and 'screening' birthday calls. 'After a year like 2020, you would think we'd learned that growing old is a treasure and maturity is a gift not everyone gets to enjoy. 'Far too many of us allow ourselves to be measured by a standard that some sternly refuse to challenge and others simply acquiesce to because fitting in and going with the flow is easier than rowing against the current. I fought this fight before and it's the battle I'm currently fighting with 30. 'How do I shake society's unwavering norms when I'm facing the relentless tick of time? It's the age-old question:'What happens when 'immovable' meets 'unstoppable'?' she wrote. Police sources tell DailyMail.com she left a suicide note on her computer. Those struggling with thoughts of suicide can call the National Suicide Hotline at 1-800-273-8255."
45,"Biden insists he has ALWAYS told Putin he'll deploy troops to Eastern Europe and claims he's being 'aggressive': Moscow tears into Joe's 'destructive step' of sending in 3,000 soldiers as Ukraine crisis escalates ",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10468497/Biden-deploy-3-000-TROOPS-Eastern-Europe-major-force-against-Putin.html,"Joe Biden says his decision to deploy troops to Eastern Europe amidst rising tensions is 'totally consistent' with what he has communicated to Russian President Vladimir Putin as Moscow accuses the U.S. president of taking 'destructive steps.' 'As long as he's acting aggressively, we are going to make sure we reassure our NATO allies in Eastern Europe that we're there and Article 5 is a sacred obligation,' he told reporters at the White House on Wednesday. The Pentagon revealed Wednesday that President Biden approved deployment of 3,000 American troops to Eastern Europe 'in the coming days' as the world watches Russia move closer to invading Ukraine. Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Alexander Grushko told Russian news agency Interfax that the U.S. moves are 'not substantiated by anyone' and are 'destructive steps which increase military tension and reduce scope for political decisions.' Defense Department spokesman John Kirby detailed on Wednesday that 2,000 troops stationed in Fort Bragg, North Carolina will deploy to Poland and Germany this week. The majority of this group – around 1,700 troops – will come from the 82nd Airborne Division's infantry brigade combat team and will go to Poland. Just a few hundred – the remaining approximately 300 – will deploy from the 18th Airborne Corps to create a joint task force capable headquarters to provide mission command in Germany. Another 1,000 troops part of a Germany-based infantry Stryker squadron will reposition to Romania at the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's (NATO) closest flank to Russia. They will add to the 900 U.S. forces already in Romania Kirby says France also intends to send troops to Romania. The movements come as the west waits to see if Moscow will invade Ukraine after moving at least 130,000 troops to its border. Russian President Vladimir Putin has repeatedly claimed he does not intend to attack Ukraine. Kirby assured reporters during his Wednesday briefing of the latest deployments: 'These are not permanent moves. They respond to current conditions. We will adjust our posture as those conditions evolve.' 'We do not believe conflict is inevitable,' he assured President Biden put 8,500 troops on heightened alert last month in preparation for movement to Eastern Europe to help bolster the region against threats from Russia should NATO activate its response force. Department of Defense Spokesperson John Kirby detailed on Wednesday the latest U.S. troop movements approved by President Joe Biden. He said that plan was laid out to the president in three parts: 1 –1,000 U.S. troops part of the Germany-based infantry Stryker squadron will reposition to Romania 'in the coming days.'This mounted cavalry unit is designed to deploy in short order and move quickly once in place. The movement to Romania will add to the 900 U.S. forces already in that country to help deter aggression from Russia and enhance defensive capabilities in frontline NATO allied states. Kirby said Pentagon Secretary Lloyd Austin discussed reposition with Romania last week and the movement there is coming at the invitations of the Romanian government. France also intends to deploy to Romania under NATO command. 2 – Approximately 2,000 troops stationed in Fort Bragg, North Carolina will deploy to Europe this week. The majority of those deployments, approximately 1,700, will comes from the 82nd Airborne Division's infantry brigade combat team, which will go to Poland.The 82nd specializes in parachute assault operations and is a rapid ready team prepared to response anywhere in the world within 18 hours. Another 300 or so are coming from the 18th Airborne Corps, which will create a joint task force capable headquarters in Germany.The corps provides mission command and is designed for rapid deployment anywhere in the world. Kirby said the Pentagon worked with Poland and Germany and have support for deployment. He assured: 'Again, these are not permanent moves. They respond to current conditions. We will adjust our posture as those conditions evolve.' 3 – All of these troop movements and deployments are 'separate and in addition' to the 8,500 U.S. military personnel put on heightened alert posture last week. Kirby said: 'Those 8,500 are not currently being deployed but remain ready to move, if called, for the NATO Response Force (NRF) or as needed for other contingencies as directed by the Secretary of by President Biden.'  'They are trained and equipped for a variety of missions during this period of elevated risk,' said a senior defense official told the Wall Street Journal, declining to to provide additional details on specific missions. They added that the deployments also are 'meant to deter the threat against the alliance.' 'We are literally willing to put skin in the game.' In addition to the 2,000-troop deployment and movement of forces already in Europe, the Pentagon has also ordered several thousand more troops be put on standby for potential deployment. None of the troops are currently authorized to enter Ukraine. As part of efforts to reassure the Kremlin about the threat it is facing, U.S. diplomats say they are willing to give Russia access to NATO bases in Poland and Romania to confirm that no Tomahawk cruise missiles are based there. Biden signed off on the plan for troop movement after meeting with Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Army General Mark Milley on Tuesday. The plan includes three different parts - the U.S. troop movement from Germany to Romania; the deployment from Fort Bragg of troops to Poland and Germany; and the continued standby of 8,500 other U.S.-based troops who were put on heightened alert late last month. U.S. lawmakers are split on Biden's decision to deploy, move and put troops on heightened alert in the midst of rising tensions in Europe. Republican Senator Lindsey Graham is in favor of it. 'I completely support the Biden Administration's decision to send more U.S. troops to bolster NATO allies in the face of Russian aggression,' the South Carolina senator tweeted on Wednesday. 'It is imperative that NATO meet the moment and that we stand firmly against Putin's efforts to divide the alliance.' On the other hand, fellow Republican Senator Mike Braun from Indiana is against it. 'I am strongly opposed to President Biden's decision to send American troops to Eastern Europe,' he tweeted along with an image of a longer statement on the matter. He claims that the U.S. should not be getting engaged in conflict when other countries should 'defend themselves'. Senator Josh Hawley, a Trump ally from Missouri, said he supports sending assistance to Kiev to help Ukraine defend itself. He is, however, against the U.S.getting so involved in the potential of war with Russia. The U.S. has already sent millions of military aid in at least six shipments to Kiev. Washington and its NATO allies have offered to open talks with Moscow on arms control and trust-building measures to defuse the Ukraine stand-off, according to copies of letters sent to Vladimir Putin that leaked today. The proposals, set out in missives by NATO and the United States last month in response to Russian demands, lay out in detail areas for future talks - including on nuclear weapons, the deployment of shot and medium-range missiles in Europe, military drills, cyber attacks, and space weapons. Both letters clearly state that Ukraine will not be banned from joining NATO, and make no reference to Russia's demand that all forces are withdrawn from ex-Soviet states. The letters do not exclude the possibility of forces being scaled down, but make it clear that this would only happen if Russia makes reciprocal moves - for example by withdrawing forces from Ukraine, Georgia and Moldova. They also note that, if Putin continues massing forces on Europe's doorstep, then NATO and the US will be 'forced' to increase their own deployments in response. Both NATO and Russia have refused to comment on the authenticity of the documents, which leaked to Spanish media. They emerged as satellite images showed Putin continuing to mass troops near Ukraine and in Crimea. A NATO official refused to confirm the text, saying: 'We never comment on alleged leaks.' Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Moscow was aware of the report but added: 'We didn't publish anything, and I don't want to comment on this.' President Vladimir Putin's government has deployed a huge force of up to 130,000 troops backed by tanks and artillery near the Ukraine border and in Crimea, a Ukrainian region that Russia annexed in 2014. The Kremlin has since demanded that NATO guarantee that Kiev never be allowed to join and that the alliance withdraw forces from eastern member states that were Soviet allies or republics during the Cold War. Western allies have dismissed calls to slam shut NATO's door, but the leaked letters call for 'meaningful arms control discussions and dialogue with Russia on mutual transparency and confidence-building measures.' 'No other partner has been offered a comparable relationship or a similar institutional framework,' the allies said of the NATO-Russia council, in the letter released by El Pais. 'Yet Russia has broken the trust at the core of our cooperation and challenged the fundamental principles of the global and Euro-Atlantic security architecture,' it says. The US document stresses: 'We are ready to consider arrangements or agreements with Russia on issues of bilateral concern, to include written, signed instruments, to address our respective security concerns.' It suggests renewing the US-Russian Strategic Stability Dialogue on arms control agreements to 'limit ground-based intermediate and shorter-range missiles and their launchers'. But it repeats Washington's warning that Russia is already in breach of the now suspended 1987 Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, which the US withdrew from in 2019, accusing Moscow of deploying a banned type of missile. And it warns: 'Further Russian increases in force posture or further aggression against Ukraine will force the United States and our Allies to strengthen our defensive posture.' The leak emerged after Putinaccused the US of trying to draw Russia into a war in Ukraine as a pretext for imposing harsh sanctions on his country. The Russian president charged Washington with using Ukraine as an 'instrument' to bully Russia and 'contain' its development, while ignoring legitimate security fears. Putin, who has rarely spoken since the Ukraine standoff began in November, said on Tuesday that he hopes a diplomatic solution to the crisis can still be found.

Putin issued a rare statement on the crisis Tuesday, speaking after a meeting with Hungary's Viktor Orban - a member of NATO - in Moscow. He said the Kremlin is still studying written responses that Washington and NATO gave to his security demands, but said it is clear that most of Russia's concerns are being ignored. Putin argued that it's possible to negotiate an end to the standoff if the interests of all parties, including Russia's security concerns, are taken into account. 'I hope that we will eventually find a solution, although we realize that it's not going to be easy,' he said. Putin said the Western allies' refusal to meet Russia's demands violates their obligations on the integrity of security for all nations. He warned that a Ukrainian accession to NATO could lead to a situation where Ukraine launches military action to reclaim control over Russian-annexed Crimea or areas controlled by Russia-backed separatists in the country's east. 'Imagine that Ukraine becomes a NATO member and launches those military operations,' Putin said. 'Should we fight NATO then? Has anyone thought about it?' Russia annexed the Crimean Peninsula in 2014 following the ouster of the country's Moscow-friendly president and later threw its weight behind rebels in Ukraine's eastern industrial heartland, triggering a conflict that has killed over 14,000 people. Putin charged that while the US airs concerns about Ukraine's security, it is using the ex-Soviet country as an 'instrument' in its efforts to contain Russia. He alleged that Washington may try to 'draw us into a military conflict and force its allies in Europe to impose the tough sanctions the U.S. is talking about now.' Another option would be to 'draw Ukraine into NATO, deploy offensive weapons there' and encourage Ukrainian nationalists to use force to reclaim the rebel-held east or Crimea, 'drawing us into a military conflict.' 'We need to find a way to ensure interests and security of all parties, including Ukraine, European nations and Russia,' Putin said, emphasizing that the West needs to treat Russian proposals seriously to make progress. He said French President Emmanuel Macron may soon visit Moscow as part of renewed diplomatic efforts following their call on Monday. Earlier this week, Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov sentletters to the U.S. and other Western counterparts pointing out obligations signed by all members of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe. Russia argues that NATO's expansion eastward has hurt Russia's security, violating the principle of 'indivisibility of security' endorsed by the OSCE in 1999 and 2010. It says the U.S. and its allies have ignored the principle that the security of one nation should not be strengthened at the expense of others, while insisting on every nation's right to choose alliances. In his letter, which was released by the foreign ministry, Lavrov said 'there must be security for all or there will be no security for anyone.' In a separate call with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, Lavrov warned that Moscow will not allow Washington to 'hush up' the issue. Blinken, meanwhile, emphasized 'the U.S. willingness, bilaterally and together with Allies and partners, to continue a substantive exchange with Russia on mutual security concerns.' However, State Department spokesman Ned Price said Blinken was resolute in 'the U.S. commitment to Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity, as well as the right of all countries to determine their own foreign policy and alliances.' Blinken 'urged immediate Russian de-escalation and the withdrawal of troops and equipment from Ukraine's borders,' Price said. He reaffirmed that 'further invasion of Ukraine would be met with swift and severe consequences and urged Russia to pursue a diplomatic path.' Senior State Department officials described the call as professional and 'fairly candid,' noting that if Russia wanted to prove it isn't going to invade Ukraine, it should withdraw its troops from the border and neighboring Belarus. Shortly after speaking to Lavrov, Blinken convened a conference call with the secretary general of NATO, the EU foreign policy chief and the chairman-in-office of the OSCE as part of efforts to ensure that the allies are engaged in any further contacts with Russia. Speaking to reporters at the United Nations, Russia's U.N. ambassador, Vassily Nebenzia, said the U.S. statement about its readiness for dialogue 'doesn't correlate' with Washington sending planeloads of military equipment to Ukraine. 'I don't know why the U.S. is escalating tensions and at the same time accusing Russia,' he said. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson visited Kyiv for scheduled talks with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Johnson said the U.K. has a package of measures including sanctions ready to go 'the moment the first Russian toecap crosses further into Ukrainian territory.' 'It is vital that Russia steps back and chooses a path of diplomacy, and I believe that is still possible,' Johnson said. 'We are keen to engage in dialogue, of course we are. But we have the sanctions ready.' He said he would have a call with Putin on Wednesday, noting that the Russian leader was trying to 'impose a new Yalta, new zones of influence' in a reference to the 1945 deal between the allied powers. 'And it would not just be Ukraine that was drawn back into the Russian sphere of influence,' Johnson added. In other developments, Biden was expected to nominate career foreign service officer Bridget Brink to assume the long-vacant diplomatic post of American ambassador to Ukraine, according to a U.S. official familiar with the decision. Brink currently serves as the ambassador to Slovakia."
46,Beijing's bid to scupper Western sanctions against Moscow: China looks to create closer financial ties with Russia which could protect both countries from monetary punishments,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10468449/Russia-China-discuss-closer-gas-financial-ties-Putin-visit-says-Kremlin.html,"Russia and China are working onfinancial deals that will limit the impact of potential Western-imposed monetary punishments, the Kremlin has warned. Kremlin aide Yuri Ushakov said President Vladimir Putin is preparing to meet Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping in Beijing on Friday to discuss their 'common views' on security, amid fears Russia is preparing to invade Ukraine. Ushakov said Moscow and Beijing were making serious efforts to create joint financial infrastructure that could safeguard Russia-China cooperation from potential sanctions from other countries, many of which have threatened to impose restrictions on Russia should military action be taken. He added that the Kremlin was confident China would back Russia over its security concerns with the West, asNATO leaders pursue diplomatic efforts to avert a feared Russian invasion but have continued to turn down Russian demands. Concerns have also been mounting in recent months that China could launch its own invasion of Taiwan, withXi's rhetoric becoming increasingly hostile. Tensions between Taipei and Beijing, which claims the democratically-ruled island as its own territory, have risen in the past two years as China steps up military activities near Taiwan to pressure it to accept Chinese rule. Experts have suggested China is intently following the US and European response over Ukraine to gauge what might happen if it were to move against Taiwan. Putin and Xi will have lunch together on Friday which will see the opening ceremony of the Winter Olympics, and could sign more than 15 agreements, Ushakov told reporters today, with lots of new deals being prepared in relation to natural gas. 'A joint statement on international relations entering a new era has been prepared for the talks,' Ushakov said, adding that it will reflect Moscow and Beijing's 'common views' on security among other issues. 'China supports Russia's demands for security guarantees,' Ushakov added. Western leaders have accused Russia of amassing more than 100,000 troops on its borders with pro-Western Ukraine and preparing for a potential invasion. The West has warned that a Russian attack would be met with 'severe consequences' including wide-ranging economic sanctions. Russia denies any plans to invade, instead accusing the West of failing to respect Moscow's security concerns on its borders. Russian officials have put forward a series of demands to ease tensions, including bans on Ukraine joining NATO and on the deployment of missile systems near Russia's borders, as well as a pullback of the US-led military alliance's forces in eastern Europe. Competition got underway in the Beijing Winter Olympics today as the shadow of war in Ukraine and the impending arrival of Putin, who will attend Friday's opening ceremony, loomed over an event already transformed by the Covid-19 pandemic. Ushakov said the possibility of Russia building a new gas pipeline to China through Mongolia was being looked at, a project that has been discussed for a long time and would take years to be fully realised. Deliveries via an existing pipeline, the Power of Siberia, a 2,485 mile (4,000 km) project that transfers gas from eastern Russia to China, began in 2019. It took around a decade to reach an agreement on supply terms. Some experts doubt that a second gas pipeline from Russia to China, which recently overtook Japan as the world´s largest importer of sea-borne liquefied natural gas, will come to pass. But Putin's visit comes at a time when the reliability of Russian gas supplies to Europe is being questioned by some Western politicians and when Moscow is keen to show it potentially has other options even if they are not realistic overnight. 'It is worth noting that the Chinese gas market is the most promising and fastest growing in the world,' said Ushakov. Spot gas prices in Europe reached all-time highs in December amid soaring demand and limited supply. Russian gas supplies to Europe have come under scrutiny as thousands of Russian troops have massed near the border of traditional gas transit nation Ukraine, raising fears of an invasion, something Moscow denies planning. Western nations have threatened a slew of sanctions should Russia make an incursion onto Ukrainian territory. Ushakov said China supported Russia's effort to extract security demands from the West. Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, Energy Minister Nikolai Shulginov and Igor Sechin, CEO of oil major Rosneft will be among the Russian delegation, Ushakov added. In his first major remarks on the crisis in weeks, Putin on Tuesday accused the West of ignoring Russia's demands and suggested Washington was using Kyiv as an instrument to potentially drag Moscow into a war. 'Ukraine itself is just a tool to achieve this goal' of containing Russia, Putin said, suggesting the aim was 'drawing us into some kind of armed conflict' in order to impose sanctions. Putin left the door open to talks however, saying he hoped that 'in the end we will find a solution'. The United States and NATO have provided written responses to Moscow's demands, which Putin said he is studying. Spanish newspaper El Pais on Wednesday published what it said were leaked copies of the responses, which showed Washington and NATO offering Moscow arms control and trust-building measures. The proposals remain firm on insisting that Ukraine and any other country has a right to apply to join the alliance. But the reported US response suggests 'reciprocal commitments by both the United States and Russia to refrain from deploying offensive ground-launched missile systems and permanent forces with a combat mission in the territory of Ukraine.' Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte was meanwhile the latest NATO leader to visit Kyiv in a show of support for Ukraine, where he met President Volodymyr Zelensky. The visit came a day after Zelensky met in Kyiv with British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who was due to hold a phone call with Putin on Wednesday. After the talks, Zelensky said Ukraine was focused 'only on peace', but insisted it has the right to defend itself. 'It is essential for dialogue to continue between Russia and the United States, between Russia and NATO,' Rutte told a joint press conference. The tensions have been aggravated by plans for joint military exercises between Russia and neighbouring Belarus, where Washington claims Moscow is preparing to send 30,000 troops. Video footage released by the Russian defence ministry on Wednesday showed tanks speeding across snowy fields in Belarus and combat helicopters flying overhead as units from both countries practised ahead of the February 10-20 drills. Johnson and the Polish prime minister were in Kyiv on Tuesday ahead of Rutte, and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan was due in Ukraine on Thursday. Erdogan will try to leverage his strategic position in NATO and rapport with Putin to help resolve the crisis, though Ankara's supplying of combat drones to Ukraine has angered Moscow. The French and German foreign ministers are also expected in Ukraine next week and to visit the frontline in the east where Kyiv's forces are battling Russian-backed separatists. Putin has said French President Emmanuel Macron could also be travelling to Moscow in the coming days. Ukraine has been battling Moscow-backed insurgencies in two separatist regions since 2014, when Moscow annexed the Crimean peninsula.More than 13,000 people have been killed in the fighting, the last major ongoing war in Europe."
47,Psaki accuses Republican Senator Josh Hawley of 'parroting' Russian misinformation after he urged Biden to DROP support for letting Ukraine into NATO because it will hurt the bid to take on China,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10469553/Psaki-accuses-Republican-Senator-Josh-Hawley-parroting-Russian-misinformation.html,"The White House on Wednesday accused Sen. Josh Hawley and other Republicans of 'parroting' Russian propaganda after he asked President Joe Biden to rule out allowing Ukraine to join NATO. Moscow has said cited the threat of NATO membership as one of the reasons why it has massed more than 100,000 troops close to Ukraine's border. And on Wednesday, Hawley wrote to Secretary of State Antony Blinken asking him to drop longstanding U.S. support for Ukraine's eventual membership in the alliance, arguing that it would undermine efforts to counter China. White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki hit back when asked whether such comments were helpful while Russia and the West were facing off over Ukrainian sovereignty. 'If you are digesting Russian misinformation and parroting Russian talking points, you are not aligned with longstanding bipartisan American values, which is to stand up for the sovereignty of countries like Ukraine, but others ... their right to choose their own alliances,' she said during her regular press briefing. 'And also to stand against, very clearly, the efforts, or attempts or potential attempts by any country to invade and take territory of another country. 'That applies to Sen. Hawley, but it also applies to others who may be parroting the talking points of Russian propagandist leaders.' Her comments came soon after the Pentagon announced it was sending almost3,000 extra troops to Poland and Romania to reinforce Eastern Europeanallies. Pentagon spokesmanJohn Kirby said the aim was to send a 'strong signal' to President Vladimir Putin. 'We know that he also bristles at NATO, about NATO. He's made no secret of that,' said Kirby. 'We are making it clear that we're going to be prepared to defend our NATO allies if it comes to that.' Hawley is one of a number of conservatives who are reluctant to back Ukraine in its struggle with Russia. Fringe figures such as Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene have suggested that Biden is backing Kiev in order to keep Ukraine from releasing damaging information about his son Hunter's business interests there. In his letter, Hawley said he backed sending weapons to Ukraine but asked for clarification on how future Ukrainian membership of NATO would be in Washington's interests. 'Our interest is not so strong, however, as to justify committing the United States to go to war with Russia over Ukraine’s fate,' he said.' 'Rather, we must aid Ukraine in a manner that aligns with the American interests at stake and preserves our ability to deny Chinese hegemony in the Indo-Pacific.' Sending forces to eastern Europe, he said, distracted from bigger strategic priorities. 'Such a deployment can only detract from the U.S. military’s ability to ready and modernize forces to deter China in the Indo-Pacific,' he wrote. As well as the White House, some Republicans expressed their disgust with Hawley. 'I hate to be so personal, but Hawley is one of the worst human beings, and a self-aggrandizing con artist,' posted Rep. Adam Kinzinger on Twitter. 'When Trump goes down I certainly hope this evil will be laid in the open for all to see, and be ashamed of.'"
48,Ukrainians fear Putin will send his troops through Chernobyl nuclear disaster zone in short-cut to invade their capital Kyiv,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10469713/Ukrainians-fear-Putin-send-troops-Chernobyl-nuclear-disaster-zone.html,"Ukrainians fear the Chernobyl nuclear disaster site could be used as a short-cut to invade the capital Kyiv by Russian invaders. Already one of the most dangerous places on earth, the radiation exclusion zone on the Belarus border could now become a battlefield. Nearly 8,000 extra Ukrainian Border Guards have been sent to the area, parts of which are still highly radioactive, 36 years after the world’s worst nuclear disaster. Ukraine is bracing for a Russian invasion, possibly from Belarus, using Chernobyl to punch through the defences allowing tanks to race southwards to Kyiv. The 1,000 square mile near-deserted exclusion zone reaches the border to the north, where up to 80,000 Russian and Belarus troops, including Spetsnaz special forces, are poised, supposedly for military exercises. Lieutenant Colonel Yuri Shakraichuk, from the Ukraine State Border Guard Service told journalists recently: ‘Chernobyl is an area of increased danger. ‘We increased the strength of protection, we increased the number of patrols and we increased the number of people in these patrols.’ MailOnline journalists were given special permission to visit the zone, a haunting, desolate area of abandoned factories, schools and houses. Overgrown concrete blocks loom from the undergrowth in the snow-covered pine forests. Visitors entering the area are given tiny Geiger counters by security officials which ping intermittently to indicate safely below-threshold readings of radiation. Only 145 civilians have resettled permanently here, mostly over 70 years old, and who, like the military, are largely unseen, in a restricted zone around the site of the 1986 nuclear power plant meltdown. A local who knows the zone said: ‘More troops have been arriving and we are seeing them patrolling and moving close to the border. ‘The zone straddles the frontier with Belarus where the Russians are camped and our forces are clearly preparing to meet them if they come this way. ‘An obvious advantage is that there are no civilians to join the resistance or get in the way. The radiation levels are now tolerable provided exposure does not last too long, but if the Russians pass through here they could be in Kiev in two hours. ‘But if they come, we will fight them. Everyone will resist no matter which direction they take’ It is believed the extra Ukrainian troops here are securing and searching abandoned buildings in case Russian Spetsnaz sneak across the border to lay the ground for an invasion. Russian troops could use abandoned buildings for cover as Ukrainian commanders might be nervous about launching air-strikes and artillery against attackers in case they further spread radiation. Radiation buried in the ground and in buildings might be pushed into the air by explosives under a bombardment. Ukrainian National Guard troops moved to the area were conducting military exercises in Chernobyl on Tuesday, just a few miles from the border. The newly-improved highway running all the way from Chernobyl to Kyiv means Russian tanks could potentially storm the 140-mile distance within a few hours. One source said: ‘It’s the obvious way in for Russia if they have their eyes on a quick armoured strike against the capital.’ Deep in the heart of the exclusion zone lies the doomed Number 4 Reactor, now shrouded in by thousands of tons of concrete and topped with a metal ‘confinement’ cover in 2016. This concrete leviathan looms large in the near-silent shadows of the forest, a reminder of the April 1986 explosion and fire which released a plume of radiation across Eastern and Western Europe, reaching all the way to the UK. Official figures claim a death toll of 31, although long term estimates vary between 4,000 and 60,000. A Ferris wheel and other children’s facilities have become poignant symbols of the hurried evacuation. They were part of a fairground set up for the Soviet May celebrations in the town of Pripyat, but would never be used as disaster struck on April 20. About 49,000 people were evacuated from the area, mainly from Pripyat itself, where thousands of workers at the plant and their families lived. Trees and foliage have overrun the once bustling worker town, where near-derelict buildings hide amongst the overgrowth. Herds of wild horses now run free and packs of wolves have returned to roam the deserted land which has lain undisturbed by humans for nearly four decades. A guide said: ‘The dogs don’t bite but they are still dangerous. These animals never leave here and their fur can carry high levels of radiation.’ It would be an easy place to hide for Russian special forces at the head of an invasion coming down from the north towards Kyiv. Meanwhile 126,000 Russian troops are also gathered along Ukraine’s eastern flank in Donbas, 500 miles from Kyiv. Many here believe Russia may try a lightning strike south to Kyiv, surrounding the city with tanks and artillery. But if they do they could face a defiant counter-attack from Ukraine forces and civilian defence units launching guerrilla attacks. A local woman - from Kyjv - said: ‘People here are worried, determined and angry. ‘Many have plans to arm themselves or have already got guns. ‘They are also joining the civil defence forces to fight Russia if they come.’ In neighbouring Belarus a Russian Krasukha 4 electronic warfare vehicle was spotted in Zarechhye, in the Gomel region. Russia is also expanding its ‘electronic warfare’ battalions towards Ukraine and these can be used to jam communications or listen in on them. The Krasukha is capable of smashing radar and aviation systems and would help an invasion by combating defensive radar systems, possibly jamming them."
49,"Inside Gwyneth Paltrow's VERY luxurious home: Goop guru gives a tour of lavish Montecito mansion that includes its own 'wellness spa' with $30,000 showerheads, hand-painted wallpaper and décor inspired by her time in London",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-10469515/Inside-Gwyneth-Paltrows-luxurious-home.html,"She's known for living her best life thanks to balancing a successful movie career with her wellness brand Goop, that has netted her a rumored $150million fortune. So it's no surprise when taking a peek insideGwyneth Paltrow's newest mansion to see the star has built herself a truly spectacular 'forever home' in Montecito, California, where she counts the likes of Oprah Winfrey, Ellen DeGeneres and Prince Harry and Meghan Markle as neighbors. The Oscar-winning star has invited fans into the luxuriously-designed house for a new feature withArchitectural Digest- that was unveiled on Wednesday. The deluxe space features a lavish kitchen, a 'show-stopping' living room, and its very own spa that includes a $30k shower system, hot tub and plunge pool that Gwyneth, 49, stresses is essential for 'good circulation.' Gwyneth and her TV producer husband Brad Falchuk reportedly purchased the home for almost $5million in 2016, and began extensive renovations on the property. While giving a tour of her house, the Goop mogul repeatedly references how it was inspired by her time living in the UK, when she was married to Coldplay front man Chris Martin. The Sliding Doors star first shows off her entryway which she 'built from the ground up' adding it was the first time she had ever done something so ambitious calling it 'quite an undertaking.' 'I think having spent so much time as an ex-pat in Europe, and really falling in love with Georgian proportions, and those kind of details, I really wanted the entryway to feel like its own special room. 'And so with the architects we conceived of having a fireplace, which is something you see a lot in Europe in an entryway, and just gives this really nice feeling of warmth and welcome as you come in.' 'The tiles reminds me, as I said, of my time living in London, and just a detail that's classic and traditional. The Oscar-winner then gives fans a glimpse of her favorite room in the house, the powder room, which she reveals has a 'hand-done antiqued mirror' and hand-painted wallpaper. 'It makes me feel very grown-up when I pee in here,' she joked. The dining room is next on the tour, which is when Gwyneth reveals she enlisted her friend, interior designer Brigette Romanek, to help furnish the house, who she has been pals with for 20 years. Teasing some friction between the pair, Gwyneth also revealed how they 'fought' over the futuristic light fitting on the ceiling. However, the duo 'landed on it being pretty cool and fabulous.' The camera then pans to her reclaimed fireplace which came from the company Chateau Domingue, and wallpaper that was hand-painted by artists MJ Atelier in Los Angeles. The kitchen, that features reclaimed Portuguese tiles, was designed by the architects who made her home, Roman and Williams, a firm based in New York. Gwyneth - who is now married to TV producer Brad - explains the importance of having the kitchen open-plan so she can cook and talk to her children,Apple Martin, 17, and Moses Martin, 15, from her previous marriage to her Coldplay ex. She also admitted to getting her inspiration from Pinterest, when making making a fluting effect with plaster over the kitchen fireplace, which she describes as being 'such a luxury.' By her own admission, Gwyneth calls her living 'bonkers in the best way' as it features a number of differing styles, including a marble bar, a swing sofa seat and lights inspired by the band Guns N' Roses. It includes a marble bar - but Gwyneth admits she hasn't been using it recently. 'Unfortunately, I'm not drinking very much this year so I'm having mostly Seedlip cocktails which is like, mocktails or sparkling water. But, when the time comes, I will heavily utilize her.' While Gwyneth describes her living room as being a 'showstopper' that title surely goes to her spa, which is the true spectacle of the home. The actress jokes that 'maybe I can write off as a business expense' considering she works in 'wellness' with brand Goop. Modeled on a spa in Paris called Bain de la Marais, the epic space shows a tiled hot tub, gold-plated showers, a cold plunge pool which she points out is 'excellent for circulation.' The faucets alone cost upwards of $30,796, and are made by R.W. Atlas. Still, it's all worth it for Gwyneth who confesses she uses the spa 'every day' and admits to pinching herself saying 'I can't believe this is our home. It's so fun.' The Iron Man star also dished in the video about her favorite meals to cook for her children. 'My son's favorite recipe that I make is turkey meatballs or turkey ragout,' said. 'And my daughter loves when I make—they're pasta lovers—I think her favorite is either this lemon Parmesan pasta that I make her or a spicy marinara. Very easy!'"
